<A NAME="ant"><h3>Ants Marching</h3></a>

He wakes up in the morning 
Does his teeth bite to eat and he's rolling 
Never changes a thing 
The week ends the week begins 
She thinks, we look at each other 
Wondering what the other is thinking 
But we never say a thing 
These crimes between us grow deeper 

Goes to visit his mommy 
She feeds him well his concerns 
He forgets them 
And remembers being small 
Playing under the table and dreaming 

Take these chances 
Place them in a box until a quieter time 
Lights down, you up and die 

Driving in on this highway 
All these cars and upon the sidewalk 
People in every direction 
No words exchanged 
No time to exchange 

And all the little ants are marching 
Red and black antennas waving 
They all do it the same 
They all do it the same way 

Candyman teasing the thoughts of a 
Sweet tooth tortured by the weight loss 
Programs cutting the corners 
Loose end, loose end, cut, cut 
On the fence, could not to offend 
Cut, cut, cut, cut 

Take these chances 
Place them in a box until a quieter time 
Lights down, you up and die 



<A NAME="ill"><h3>I'll Back You Up</h3></a>

I remember thinking 
I'll go on forever only knowing 
I'll see you again 
But I know 
The touch of you is so hard to remember 
But like that touch I know no other 

And for sure we have danced 
In the risk of each other 
Would like to dance 
Around the world with me 

I'll be falling all about my own thing 
And I know your the heaviest weight 
When your not here that's hung 
Around my head 

And your lips burn wild 
Thrown from the face of a child 
And in your eyes 
The seeing of the greatest few 
Do what you will, always 
Walk where you like, your steps 
Do as you please, I'll back you up 

I remember thinking 
Sometimes we walk 
Sometimes we run away 
But I know 
No matter how fast we are running 
Somehow we keep 
Somehow we keep up with each other 

I'll be falling all about my own thing 
And i know your the heaviest weight 
When your not here that's hung 
Around my head 

And your lips burn wild 
Thrown from the face of a child 
And in your eyes 
The seeing of the greatest few 
Do what you will, always 
Walk where you like, your steps 
Do as you please, I'll back you up 



<A NAME="min"><h3>Minarets</h3></a>

Santa Maria choose your children 
Santa Maria virgin child 
all our wars over you we are fighting 
and all our time faith justifying 

Brother caged Babylon will fall 
Sister chained and bound, beaten and bleeding 
The tv's on, to me this explains it 
Wearing a tie like daddy speaks it 
Screaming from the minarets 
Later on we'll all be dancing 
Screaming from the minarets 
Yes indeed i'm making faces 
Rain on the ground in a space 
God has grown 
Alone till a man looking glass in his hand 
He is holding up to you 
What you see 
What you see 
What you see 
What you see is human 
Screaming from the minarets 



<A NAME="one"><h3>One Sweet World</h3></a>

Nine planets round the sun 
Only one does the sun embrace 
Upon this watered one 
So much we take for granted 

So let us sleep outside tonight 
Lay down in our mother's arms 
For here we can rest safely 

If green should slip to grey 
But our hearts still bloody be 
And if mountains crumble away 
And the river dry Would it stop the stepping feet 

Take all that we can get 
When it's done 
Nobody left to bury here 
Nobody left to dig the holes 
And here we can rest safely 

One sweet world 
Around a star is spinning 
One sweet world 
And in her breath I'm swimming 
And here we will rest in peace 



<A NAME="rec"><h3>Recently</h3></a>

Recently I've been 
All of content and dreaming I have been 
'Cause I been lately seeing 
Quite a bit of this woman live on my street 

People stare and we just ignore everything 
People stare and we just ignore them 
And they go away, go away 

She comes to me 
I watch her drink 
I watch her comb her hair 
Both say that we never before have 
Felt as recently 

People stare and we just ignore 
What's the use in hiding out 
She says all the time 
Let their eyes do the worrying about 

She and me go to places quiet 
Where we are quite alone 
Kiss and we hold together 
We will be until we done 

People stare and we just ignore 
What's the use in hiding out 
She says all the time 
Let their eyes do the worring about 

Both say the we never before 
Never before have felt as recently 
People stare and we just ignore everything 
People stare and we just ignore them 
And they go away, go away 



<A NAME="sat"><h3>Satellite</h3></a>

Satellite in my eyes 
Like a diamond in the sky 
How I wonder. 
Satellite strung from the moon 
And the world your balloon 
Peeping tom for the mother station 

Winter's cold spring erases 
And the calm away by the storm is chasing 
Everything good needs replacing 
Look up, look down all around, hey satellite 

Satellite, headlines read 
Someone's secrets you've seen 
Eyes and ears have been 
Satellite dish in my yard 
Tell me more, tell me more 
Who's the king of your satellite castle? 

Winter's cold spring erases 
And the calm away by the storm is chasing 
Everything good needs replacing 
Look up, look down all around, hey satellite 
Rest high above the clouds no resrictions 
Television we bounce 'round the world 
And while I spend these hours 
Five senses reeling, 
I laugh about the weatherman's satellite eyes. 

Satellite in my eyes 
Like a diamond in the sky 
How i wonder. 
Satellite strung from the moon 
And the world your balloon 
Peeping tom for the mother station 

Winter's cold spring erases 
And the calm away by the storm is chasing 
Everything good needs replacing 
Look up, look down all around, hey satellite 

Rest high above the clouds no restrictions 
Television you bounce from the world 
And while I spend these hours 
Five senses reeling 
I laugh about this world in my satellite eyes. 
 
 
   
<A NAME="see"><h3>Seek Up</h3></a>

Sometimes I feel like I'm falling 
Fall back again, fall back again, 
Fall back again, fall back again 

Oh, life it seems a struggle between 
What we think what we see 
I'm not going to change my ways 
Just to please you or appease you 
Inside a crowd, five billion proud 
Willing to punch it out 
Right, wrong, weak, strong 
Ashes to ashes all fall down 
Look around about this round 
About this merry-go-round around 
If at afll God's gaze upon us fall 
His mischievous grin, look at him 

Forget about the reasons and 
The treasons we are seeking 
Forget about the notion that 
Our emtions can be swept away 
Forget about being guilty, 
We are innocent instead 
For soon we will all find our lives swept away 

Sit awhile with TV's hungry child 
Big belly swelled 
Oh, for a price of a coke or a smoke 
Keep alive those hungy eyes 
Take a look at me, what you see in me, 
Mirror look at me 
Face it all, face it all again 

Forget about the reasons and 
The treasons we are seeking 
Forget about the notion that your emtions can be 
Wwept away, kept at bay 
Forget about being guilty, i am innocent instead 
For soon we will all find our lives swept away 

You seek up an emotion 
And our cup is overflowing 
You seek up an emotion, 
Sometimes your well is dry 
You seek up a big monster 
For him to fight your wars for you 
But when he finds his way to you, the devil's not 
Going--ha, ha 

Say, say 

Look at me in my fancy car 
And my bank account 
Oh, how I wish I could take it all down 
Into my grave, I'd save 
Take a look again, take a look again, 
Take a look again 
Everyday things change,...stay the same 

Forget about the reasons and 
The treasons we are seeking 
Forget about the notion that 
Your emtions can be swept away 
Intentions are not wicked, 
Don't be tricked into thinking so 
Soon we will all find our lives swept away 

You seek up an emotion 
And our cup is overflowing 
You seek up an emotion, 
Sometimes your well is dry 
You seek up a big monster 
For him to fight your wars for you 
But when he finds his way to you, 
The devil's not going--ha, ha 
Fall back again, fall back again, fall back again... 



<A NAME="son"><h3>Song that Jane Likes</h3></a>

And in plays to write the wire in 
I'll come back again 
Torching time talking rhymes in 
I'll come back again 

Would you like to play 
With the thought of a friend 
In a distant passing stage 
While you lie around 
With hands up and down 
So resigned you will fall down 

While you around here play 
Wild on the warm and far away 
While you around here play 
The days keep scrbbling themselves 
In tidy lines 

Would like to play 
With a fool holding hands 
With a one-eyed jack of spades 
While on the deck they sing 
All of the captain's cards are kings 
Still he and the queen are lost at sea 
I hope it isn't you and me 

And I'll be back 'round again 
Yes I'll walk in time with you old friend 
And we'll find that place 
That we had danced so long ago 

And in plays to write the wire in 
I'll come back again 
Torching time talking rhymes in 
I'll come back again 
With this resigned 
The letter I sign 



<A NAME="tri"><h3>Tripping Billies</h3></a>

We were above 
You standing underneath us 
We were not yet lovers 
Dragons were smoked 
Bumblebees were stinging us 
I was soon to be crazy 

Eat, drink and be merry 
For tomorrow we die 
'Cause we're tripping billies 

We're wearing nothing 
Nothing but out shadows 
Shadows falling down on the beach sand 
Remembering once, 
Out on the beaches we wore 
Pineapple grass bracelets 

So why would you care 
To get out of this place 
You and me and all our freinds 
Such a happy human race 
'Cause we're tripping billies 

We are all sitting 
Legs crossed round a fire 
My yellow flame she dances 
Tequila drinking oh our 
Minds will wonder 
To wonderous places 

So why would you care 
To get out of this place 
You and me and all our friends 
Such a happy human race 

Eat, drink and be merry 
For tomorrow we die 
 
 
 
<A NAME="chr"><h3>Christmas Song</h3></a>

She was his girl; he was her boyfriend 
She be his wife; take him as her husband 
A surprise on the way, any day, any day 
One healthy little giggling dribbling baby boy 
The wise men came three made their way 
To shower him with love 
While he lay in the hay 
Shower him with love love love 
Love love love 
Love love is all around 

Not very much of his childhood was known 
Kept his mother Mary worried 
Always out on his own 
He met another Mary for a reasonable fee, less than 
Reputable as known to be 

His heart was full of love love love 
Love love love 
Love love is all around 
When Jesus Christ was nailed to the his tree 
Said "oh, Daddy-o I can see how it all soon will be 
I came to shed a little light on this darkening scene 
Instead I fear I spill the blood of my children all around" 

The blood of our children all around 
The blood of our children all around 
The blood of our children all around 
So the story goes, so I'm told 
The people he knew were 
Less than golden hearted 
Gamblers and robbers 
Drinkers and jokers, all soul searchers 
Like you and me 

Rumors insisited he soon would be 
For his deviations 
Taken into custody by the authorities 
Less informed than he. 
Drinkers and jokers. all soul searchers 
Searching for love love love 
Love love love 
Love love is all around 

Preparations were made 
For his celebration day 
He said "eat this bread and think of it as me 
Drink this wine and dream it will be 
The blood of our children all around 
The blood of our children all around" 
The blood of our children all around 

Father up above, why in all this anger have you fill 
Me up with love 
Fill me love love love 
Love love love 
Love love 
And the blood of our children all around
