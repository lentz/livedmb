D      C     F        Dmajsus4(+9) 
And in plays to write the wire in 

Am
I'll come back again

D        C    F       Dmajsus4(+9)
Torching time talking rymes in

Am
I'll come back again

Hey!

G     C        Am    F     Dmajsus4(+9)
Would you like to play?

G      C            Am
With a thought of a friend 

Am   F       Dmajsus4(+9)
In a distant passing stage.

G     C       Am      F      Dmajsus4(+9)
While you lie around

G         C            Am
With your hands up and out

F                    Dmajsus4(+9)
So resigned you will fall down


G         C     Am         F      Dmajsus4(+9)
While all you around here play

G        C       Am        F      Dmajsus4(+9)
Wild on the warm and far away

G         C     Am         F 
While all you around here play

Em            Am     
The days keep scribbling themselves 

F
In tidy lines

G         C       Am      F    Dmajsus4(+9)
Would you like to play?

G       C            Am
With a fool holding hands

Am        F          Dmajsus4(+9)
With a one-eyed jack of spades

G         C       Am         F       Dmajsus4(+9)
While all on the deck they sing

G   C                 Am         F     Dmajsus4(+9)
All of the captain's cards are kings.......Still

G  C        Am      F       Em
He and the queen are lost at sea

Am              F       
I hope it isn't you and me.

G           C       Am    F     Dmajsus4(+9)
And I'll be back 'round again

G         C       Am        F      Dmajsus4(+9)
Yes I'll walk in time with you old friend

G          C      Am    F 
And we'll find that place

Em          Am
That we had danced in so long ago


D      C        F         Dmajsus4(+9)
And In plays to write the wire in 

Am
I'll come back again

D        C       F         Dmajsus4(+9)
Torching time talking rhymes in 

Am
I'll come back again
F           Am
With this resigned
F          Am
the letter I'll sign


Exit
C    Dmajsus4(+9)     C      E    E(mute)    G
