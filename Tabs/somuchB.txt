So Much to Say (Bass Tab)
-------------------------
transcribed by Justin Marks


Here's Stefan Lessard's bass part for "So Much To Say," or at least the
main structure of it. The way he plays bass, much is left to little
variations in the groove, but he does have a general body to his
playing.

I won't put any of those stylistic markers (i.e., hammers, pull-offs,
etc.) because he does not do them consistenely.

Verse:

G ----9-6-----9-12-------------9-6---------9-6----12/7
D --7-----7--------0-5-0-5-6-7-----7---5-7-----7--12/7
A ----------7------------------------7----------------
E ----------------------------------------------------

End of verse before chorus:

G ----------------------------
D --7-7---7-7---7-7---7-7-----
A ------7-----7-----7-----7-4-
E ----------------------------

Chorus:

G -------------------7-7---7---------------------------
D -----7-7---7-----7-----7---5-5---5-5---5-4-4---4-5-7-
A ---7-----7---5-5---------------5-----5-------5-------
E -5---------------------------------------------------

But listen carefully, because Stefan plays so subtily and Steve
Lillywhite mixes him so low that his parts can change drastically
(rythmically-speaking, too) without being noticed. So you're really
better off hearing the parts for yourself, but this should help. Hint:
listen for the muted playing, especially in the chorus.

Enjoy,
Justin Marks
