This is a pretty straightforward song, so I've only tabbed out the
major parts -- you'll have to cut and paste as necessary, but it
should all be here.  Dave mutes many of the strings and articulates
the up and down strokes carefully in this song...the best way to
learn as always is to sit and play along.

Here's a few words from Ethan Bauley:

This progression assumes that the bass lick goes between B and E 

The verse part doesn't really have any guitar; just the bass 

The next part, where he says "Crazy how you make it alright" goes to C 
one for one bar, then to B, then back to the verse 

After the next verse, after the C to B part, he goes down to an open E 
major for a bar.  

After the open E, the "Lovely lady..." part goes two bars G, two bars A, 
one bar of C, twice.  

The "It's crazy, I'm thinking" part has two bars of C major, two beats of 
F, two beats of G, then another bar of C before going back to the open E, 
which goes back to the "Lovely lady" part.  

Yadda, yadda yadda, the violin lick to the "It's crazy..." part goes 
g-4-5--4-5--4-5--4-5--4-5-4-2-0------

Here's a few words from Kyle Bradstreet:

I believe that Sean posted it as C-G-E(SOMETHING)-D from working with it
and using my ears, i concluded that it goes something like 

C- G- C- B( note, not chord )

i am pretty sure that this is more accurate than the other version, but by
no means perfect any help would be EXTREMELY appreciated please e-mail me 
with corrections
