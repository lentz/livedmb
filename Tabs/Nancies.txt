Dancing Nancies is roughly as follows:

G                 F#
could I have been anyone other than me...

G - F#
he stands touch his head shoes untied
tongue gaping stare could i have been
magnet for money
could i have been anyone other than me

twenty three i'm so tired of life
such a shame to throw it all away
the images grow darker still
could i have been anyone other than me

A              D		    A
look up at the sky my mouth is open wide
lick and taste what's the use in hurrying
what's the use in worrying

D	    F#		   G
turn turn we almost become dizzy

(back to the G-F# pattern)

The last pattern in this song is

Bm - D - A - F#7sus4 (which looks like this)

		-4------
		-4------
		-6------
		-6------
		-4------
		-4------
Bm		    D  		 A		
sing and dance i'll play for you tonight

		F#7sus4	
the thrill of it all

Bm		D		A	
dark clouds may hang over me sometimes

		F#7sus4
but i'll work it out
