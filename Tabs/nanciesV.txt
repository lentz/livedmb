Violin Tablature: Dancing Nancies
---------------------------------
transcribed by Jon Sung

I'm new at this tabbing thing, but I've been playing Dave for two years
now and I'm pretty sure I know what's what.  I tend to make up a lot of
my own stuff, so I'm not going to bother with any of Boyd's solos.  I
will let you know what key things are in, and throw in a few hints here
and there.  Other than that, just loosen up and have fun with it!  

I didn't tab this out to any time signature; I figure if you're good
enough to play Dave, you know what you're doing!  Although where I feel
the tab could use some help, I threw in some + signs to mark the chord
changes (and I'll tell you what the changes are; I also play the guitar.
 Hopefully you won't need my background to get the tab though!).
       
Verses: I usually don't play here; feels like there's enough going on already.

Chorus: "My eyes open wide" etc.  This is pretty simple: D to A.  +
signs are the chord changes from D to A.  At the end, with "almost
become dizzy," go to Bb.

    +      +               		   +
E-|--------------------------------------------------------------------
A-|--------0---(repeat)---------1----------------------------------
D-|--0--------------------------------------------------------------
G-|-------------------------------------------------------------------

Immediately after the chorus, Boyd's solos arrive.  These are all in D
Major, and tend to start on a high B.  Go nuts!

Bridge (?) "Sing and dance, la la la hey" etc: + signs mark changes from
Bm - D - A - C#m.  This is in E:

     +  +  +  +      or   +  +  +  +
E-|--1--3--0--2----------------------------------------------------
A-|-----------------------1--3--0--2---(in D Major)--------------
D-|----------------------------------------------------------------
G-|-------------------------------------------------------------------

The "coming down" part after the madness at the end (just take a finger,
make 5ths on the A and E strings, and slide up and down like crazy) is
something approximate to this (it's different every time; nobody's
perfect!):  [it's in D Major by the way]

E-|----------0--1--2--1---------0--1--2--3-----------------------
A-|---2--3----------------2--3-------------------------------
D-|----------------------------------------------------------------
G-|-------------------------------------------------------------------
