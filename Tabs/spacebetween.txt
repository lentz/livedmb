Lyrics:

FIG. 1
Come up quickly, so quickly,
There's no hope for you for me,
No corner you could squeeze me,
But I've got all the time for you, love.

Fig. 2
The space between,
The tears we cry as the laughter
keeps coming back for more,
The space between our wicked lies is where
we hope to keep

FIG. 1
safe from the pain.
but will I hold you again?
these fickle <?unknown word?> words conguse me,
like will it rain today,
we waste the hours with talking, talking
it's twisted games we're playing

Fig. 2
we strange our lives,
with warring hearts what wild eye meets you and me,
The space between our wicked lies is where
we hope to keep

FIG. 1
safe from the pain.
but will I hold you again?
will I hold you again?

FIG. 3
look at us spinning, love, in the
madness of a roller coaster.
you know you went off like a devil in
a church in the middle of a crowded room
all I can sat that love is hope it don't
take me sin down

FIG. 2
The space between where you smile and hide
is where you'll find me if i get to go
the space between the bullets in our fire
find is where i'll be hiding waiting for you

the rain that falls splash in your heart
ran like silence down the window into your room

the space bewteen our wicked lies is where
we hope to keep

FIG. 1
safe from the pain.

FIG. 2
Take my hand cuz we're walking out of yeah
right out right ouy of here but love is all
you need in the 

space between whats wrong and right
is where you'll find me hiding waiting for
you

the space between you heart and mine is the 
space we fill with time
the space between...
the space between...
