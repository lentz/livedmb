<A NAME="aft"><h3>After Her</h3></a>
After Her

sun will shine no matter what I do
sun shines bright now with you
what a wonderful thing for you to do
moon shine bright reflection in your eyes 
a finer place he could not find

winter's cold spring erases
and the calm away by the storm is chasen
everything good needs replacing 
hope all these changes happen with you

in my life never before have I lover so adored
her eyes her hair everything she says
my delight can tickle me inside
touch my heart touch my mind

no matter what's inside I'll give to her
no need to satisfy my hunger lost in her
and while I spend these hours
five senses reading
with biggest steps I'm running
after her I will run

winter's cold spring erases
and the calm away by the storm is chasen
everything good needs replacing 
hope all these changes happen with you

sun will shine no matter what I do
sun shines bright now with you
touch my heart touch me through

no matter what's inside I'll give to her
no need to satisfy my hunger lost in her
and while I spend these hours
five senses reading
with biggest steps I'm running
after her I will run

after her
after her
after her


<A NAME="rou"><h3>Route Two</h3></a>

She walks through my head (?)
Oh mountains change my way
Walking would have been faster
But mountains got in the way
Lotta snow today
Lotta snow today
And we go here (?)
Got me tired again

Hey
Drive two miles an hour down a mountain trail
Don't go any faster, gonna lose my way
Can't go any faster, gonna lose my way
Right on the mountain, snow today

Heeeeeeeey
Heeeeeeeey
Again we play

Giddyup giddyup away
Giddyup giddyup away

Gonna be late if we don't find our way
Hurry, yeah
Oh hustle
Oh hustle
Ohhh away...
Hey...


<A NAME="wha"><h3>What Will Become of Me</h3></a>

I was falling always
and now I'm falling this way
what will become of me?
when I'm all far away 

I'm spinning down 
I'm spinning up
upon this way
wondering what will become of me
when I'm all far away 

I'm spinning down
I'm all away
a greater way 

what will become of me


<A NAME="wei"><h3>Weight of the World</h3></a>

Oh in excitement 
home that we call this
we charge with an eye on the line
and we go over
oh proud and strong
we come down on babies and mothers
and leave them to die
while we plant all over
and call it home

So weep at life
and leave me pray there
but still I should call it home
native soil
has anyone stolen land
and I love it like no other

And now my grandfather say
open your charge
you charge when the trumpet calls
blow on your flute 
pound on your drum
victory calls
oh no mother or child could
resist any strong beat
drive on west
we will plant we will grow

Wait and see my heart is bleeding
but still I should call it home
and teach my babies
my sons and my daughters
to love this place
and share it with no one

Then we started we ???? bounty
I will plant my wheat
I will hold my land here
I will protect my ones
I will protect my golden
I will stand up on top
and scream that I own land

But what if the spirit lies in this way
still should I call it home
and then I will tell
my sons and my daughters
to hold it so dear
and share it with all
then I will tell
my sons and my daughters 
to hold it so dear 
and share it with everyone

This land is your land 
this land is my land
from California to the New York islands
from the red wood forests
to the gulf stream waters
this land was made for you and me


<A NAME="all"><h3>All Along The Watchtower (Bob Dylan)</h3></a>

There must be some way out of here,
Said the joker to the thief.
There's too much confusion
I can't get no relief

Business men they,
drink my wine.
There plowmen dig my earth.
None of them along the line
know what any of it's worth.

No reason to get excited,
the thief he kindly spoke.
There are many among us,
who feel that life is but a joke (Ha Ha- Ha ha)

But you and I we've been through all that,(Yes we have)
and this is not our fate.
So let us not talk falsely,
the hour is getting late

And All along the Watchtower,
prince's kept the view.
While all the women all the women all the women came and went
Barefoot servants too.
Out side in the cold distance, 
a wild cat did growl la la la la la
Two riders two riders approaching,
the wind began to howl

The thief he take
my money take
The thief he take 
my money take

Am I insane
Auf Wiedersehen
Am I insane
The thief is safe

NO REASON TO GET EXCITED! (YEAH!....)


<A NAME="ang"><h3>Angel from Montgomery (John Prine)</h3></a>

I am an old woman named after my mother 
My old man is another child that's grown old 
If dreams were lightning, thunder were desire 
This old house would have burnt down a long time ago 

Make me an angel that flies from Montgomery 
Make me a poster from an old rodeo 
Just give me one thing that I can hold on to 
To believe in this living is just a hard way to go 

When I was a young girl, well I had me a cowboy 
He weren't much to look at, just a free rambling man 
But that was a long time and no matter how I try 
The years just flow by like a broken down dam 

There's flies in the kitchen, I can hear 'em there buzzing 
And I ain't done nothing since I woke up today 
How the hell can a person go to work in the morning 
And come home in the evening and have nothing to say 


<A NAME="eye"><h3>Eyes of the World (The Grateful Dead)</h3></a>

Right outside this lazy summer home,
you ain't got time to call your soul a critic, no . . .
Right outside the lazy gate of winter's summer home,
wonderin' where the nut-thatch winters,
wings a mile long just carried the bird away. 

Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world,
the heart has its beaches, its homeland and thoughts of its own.
Wake now discover that you are the song that the morning brings,
the heart has its seasons, its evenings and songs of its own. 

There comes a redeemer, and he slowly too fades away,
there follows his wagon behind him that's loaded with clay.
The seeds that were silent all burst into bloom, and decay,
and night comes so quiet, it's close on the heels of the day. 

Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world,
the heart has its beaches, its homeland and thoughts of its own.
Wake now discover that you are the song that the morning brings,
the heart has its seasons, its evenings and songs of its own. 

Sometimes we live no particular way but our own,
sometimes we visit your country and live in your homes,
sometimes we ride on your horses,
sometimes we walk alone,
sometimes the songs that we hear are just songs of our own. 

Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world,
the heart has its beaches, its homeland and thoughts of its own.
Wake now discover that you are the song that the morning brings,
the heart has its seasons, its evenings and songs of its own. 
 

<A NAME="ifi"><h3>If I Had a Boat (Lyle Lovett)</h3></a>

If I had a boat
I'd go out on the ocean
And if I had a pony
I'd ride him on my boat
And we could all together
Go out on the ocean
Me upon my pony on my boat

If I were Roy Rogers
I'd sure enough be single
I couldn't bring myself to marrying old Dale
It'd just be me and trigger
We'd go riding through them movies
Then we'd buy a boat and on the sea we'd sail

And if I had a boat
I'd go out on the ocean
And if I had a pony
I'd ride him on my boat
And we could all together
Go out on the ocean
Me upon my pony on my boat

The mystery masked man was smart
He got himself a Tonto
'Cause Tonto did the dirty work for free
But Tonto he was smarter
And one day said kemo sabe
Kiss my ass I bought a boat
I'm going out to sea

And if I had a boat
I'd go out on the ocean
And if I had a pony
I'd ride him on my boat
And we could all together
Go out on the ocean
Me upon my pony on my boat

And if I were like lightning
I wouldn't need no sneakers
I'd come and go wherever I would please
And I'd scare 'em by the shade tree
And I'd scare 'em by the light pole
But I would not scare my pony on my boat out on the sea

And if I had a boat
I'd go out on the ocean
And if I had a pony
I'd ride him on my boat
And we could all together
Go out on the ocean
Me upon my pony on my boat


<A NAME="isc"><h3>Is Chicago, Is Not Chicago (Soul Coughing)</h3></a>

A man drives a plane into the Chrysler building.

Saskatoon is in the room.
Bennetsville is in the room.
Tukwila is in the room.
Palmyra is in the room.

Is Chicago!
Is not Chicago!

A man cuts in half just like he snaps a pencil.

Khartoum is in the room.
Pyongyang is in the room.
Cairo is in the room.
Beijing is in the room.


<A NAME="joh"><h3>John the Revelator (Willie Johnson)</h3></a>

Come fill me up,
Oh when I'm dry and cold, when i'm emptied out.
With voice I shout
Oh when my words come, listen there upon.
I play my cards
But it's by the grace of God that I play my cards at all.
Come fill me up;
Oh, fill me when I'm empty, when I'm all dried out.

Now rain, rain, rain down on me;
Again, and again,
Rain down on me.

Oh I see it now;
When I saw you standing there like an angel you came down
To fill me up.
Oh fill me now, oh darkness and light fill me now

Whose that writng? John the Revelator
Whose that writng? John the Revelator

Oh rain, rain, rain down on me
again, and again
Oh, rain down on me

Oh I see it now
Oh tell them all, tell them all dying up and drink the blood
I see it now
It's like the devil and the lord go dancin on and on

Whose that writng? John the Revelator
Whose that writng? John the Revelator
Whose that writng? John the Revelator
Wrote the book of the book of seven seas

Oh rain, rain, rain down on me
Again, and again
Oh, rain down on me

Whose that writng? John the Revelator
Whose that writng? John the Revelator
Whose that writng? John the Revelator

<A NAME="lit"><h3>Little Thing</h3></a>
Oh, hello and goodbye
so fast it's gone
I can't get your face from my mind
can't get your eyes from my
can't stop your voices
on that day you told me directions to 
where I don't know now
it all flew by me
so all I can do is hope that you
come my way
oh and you're nowhere near me
that you'll be there and hope that
with luck, I'll see you again

Oh I didn't get your name
nor you mine
or the time of day
but you're stuck on me like a fly on a table
oh I'm waiting here where we stood for just a moment
and you stole my way
and I, and I wonder will I see you again
and way, way
without the smile, the smile that blows away
the wait is too long
I want this thing to go on
and there's no way that I might find you again
I must walk a way

I'm all released by time
bump into each other
it seems so right
and say hey aren't you the
weren't you the
don't you think
but I don't think it's going to happen today
I fear you'll remain a dream
rain, rain on me, yeah, yeah, yeah
your life is burned
your life burned into me
it did it
will I ever


<A NAME="lon"><h3>Long Black Veil (M. Wilkens & D. Dill)</h3></a>

Ten years ago on a cold, dark night
Someone was kill beneath the town hall light

There were few at the scene but they all did agree
the slayer who ran, looked a lot like me

She walks these hills, in along black veil
she visits my grave, when the night winds wail
nobody knows, nobody sees, nobody knows but me

The judge said "Son what is your alibi, if you were somewhere else then you don't have to die"
Well I spoke not a word though it meant my life
for I had been in the arms, of my best friends wife 

She walks these hills, in along black veil
she visits my grave, when the night winds wail
nobody knows, nobody sees, nobody knows but me

Well the scaffold is high and eternity is near
she stood in the crowd and shed not a tear
but sometimes at night when the cold wind blows in a long black vail she cries over my bones

She walks these hills, in along black veil
she visits my grave, when the night winds wail
nobody knows, nobody sees, nobody knows but me
nobody knows, nobody sees, nobody knows but me


<A NAME="lov"><h3>Love of My Life (C. Santana/D. Matthews)</h3></a>

Where you are is where I want to be,
And through your eyes all the things I want to see,
And in the night you are my dream,
Youre everything to me.

Youre the love, of my life;
And the breath, in my prayer.
Take my hand, lead me back;
What i need is you again.

I cant forget the taste of your mouth,
And from your lips all the heavens fall out.
I cant forget, we are one now;
It's you alone and I am free.

Every day, Every night
You Alone, You're the love of my life.

Every day, Every night
You Alone, You're the love of my life.

We go dancing in the moonlight
With the starlight in your eyes
We go dancing 'til the sun rise
You and me, we're gonna dnace, dance, dance.


<A NAME="mea"><h3>Me and Julio Down By the Schoolyard (Paul Simon)</h3></a>

The mama pajama rolled out of bed
And she ran to the police station
When the papa found out he began to shout
And he started the investigation
It's against the law
It was against the law
What the mama saw
It was against the law 

The mama looked down and spit on the ground
Everytime my name gets mentioned
The papa said oy if I get that boy
I'm gonna stick him in the house of detention
Well I'm on my way
I don't know where I'm going
I'm on my way I'm taking my time
But I done know where
Goodbye to Rosie the queen of Corona
See you, me and Julio
Down by the schoolyard
See you, me and Julio
Down by the schoolyard
Me and Julio down by the schoolyard 

In a couple of days they come and
Take me away
But the press let the story leak
And when the radical priest
Come to get me released
We was all on the cover of Newsweek
And I'm on my way
I don't know where I'm going
I'm on my way I'm taking my time
But I don't know where
Goodbye to Rosie the queen of Corona
See you, me and Julio
Down by the schoolyard
See you, me and Julio
Down by the schoolyard
See you, me and Julio
Down by the schoolyard


<A NAME="red"><h3>Redemption Song (Bob Marley)</h3></a>

Old pirates yes they rob I
Sold I to the merchant ships
Minutes after they took I
From the bottomless pit
But my hand was made strong
By the hand of the Almighty
We forward in this generation triumphantly
All I ever had is songs of freedom
Cause all I ever had redemption songs, redemption songs 

Emancipate yourself from mental slavery
None but ourselves can free our minds
Have no fear for atomic energy
Cause none of them can stop the time
How long shall they kill our prophets
While we stand aside and look
Some say it's just a part of it,
We've got to fulfill the book 

Won't you help to sing, these songs of freedom
Cause all I ever had, redemption songs, redemption songs 

Emancipate yourself from mental slavery
None but ourselves can free our minds
Have no fear for atomic energy
Cause none of them can stop the time
How long shall they kill our prophets
While we stand aside and look
Some say it's just a part of it,
We've got to fulfill the book 

Won't you help to sing, these songs of freedom
Cause all I ever had, redemption songs
All I ever had, redemption songs
These songs of freedom...


<A NAME="sta"><h3>Stairway to Heaven (Led Zepplin)</h3></a>

There's a lady who's sure 
All that glitters is gold 
And she's buying the stairway to heaven. 
When she gets there she knows 
If the stores are all closed 
With a word she can get what she came for. 
Ooh, ooh, and she's buying the stairway to heaven. 

There's a sign on the wall 
But she wants to be sure 
'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings. 
In a tree by the brook 
There's a songbird who sings, 
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven. 
Ooh, it makes me wonder, 
Ooh, it makes me wonder. 

There's a feeling I get 
When I look to the west, 
And my spirit is crying for leaving. 
In my thoughts I have seen 
Rings of smoke through the trees, 
And the voices of those who stand looking. 
Ooh, it makes me wonder, 
Ooh, it really makes me wonder. 

And it's whispered that soon 
If we all call the tune 
Then the piper will lead us to reason. 
And a new day will dawn 
For those who stand long 
And the forests will echo with laughter. 

If there's a bustle in your hedgerow 
Don't be alarmed now, 
It's just a spring clean for the May queen. 
Yes, there are two paths you can go by 
But in the long run 
There's still time to change the road you're on. 
And it makes me wonder. 

Your head is humming and it won't go 
In case you don't know, 
The piper's calling you to join him, 
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow, 
And did you know 
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind. 

And as we wind on down the road 
Our shadows taller than our soul. 
There walks a lady we all know 
Who shines white light and wants to show 
How everything still turns to gold. 
And if you listen very hard 
The tune will come to you at last. 
When all are one and one is all 
To be a rock and not to roll. 


<A NAME="swe"><h3>Sweet Home Alabama (Lynard Skynard)</h3></a>

Big wheels keep on turning
Carry me home to see my kin
Singing songs about the Southland
I miss Alabamy once again
And I think its a sin, yes 

Well I heard mister Young sing about her
Well, I heard ole Neil put her down
Well, I hope Neil Young will remember
A Southern man don't need him around anyhow 

Sweet home Alabama
Where the skies are so blue
Sweet Home Alabama
Lord, I'm coming home to you 

In Birmingham they love the governor
Now we all did what we could do
Now Watergate does not bother me
Does your conscience bother you?
Tell the truth 

Sweet home Alabama
Where the skies are so blue
Sweet Home Alabama
Lord, I'm coming home to you
Here I come Alabama 

Now Muscle Shoals has got the Swampers
And they've been known to pick a song or two
Lord they get me off so much
They pick me up when I'm feeling blue
Now how about you? 

Sweet home Alabama
Where the skies are so blue
Sweet Home Alabama
Lord, I'm coming home to you 

Sweet home Alabama
Oh sweet home baby
Where the skies are so blue
And the governor's true
Sweet Home Alabama
Lordy
Lord, I'm coming home to you
Yea, yea Montgomery's got the answer


<A NAME="tan"><h3>Tangerine (Led Zepplin)</h3></a>

Measuring a summer's day, I only 
finds it slips away to grey,
The hours, they bring me pain.

Tangerine, Tangerine, Living reflection 
from a dream, I was her love, she was
my queen, And now a thousand years between.

Thinking how it used to be, Does she still 
remember times like these?

To think of us again? And I do.
Tangerine, Tangerine, Living reflection from a dream;
I was her love, she was my queen,
And now a thousand years between.


<A NAME="bea"><h3>The Beauty of Wynona (Daniel Lanois)</h3></a>

The ingots are burning red
I'm working time and a half
Tomorrow I'll stay in bed,
what a hell it is, what a life

I burn my fingers, why don't you
laugh with the rest who know it well
I tripped and then I fell for
the beauty of Wynona

At night I toss and I turn
and I try and dial your number
It's changed and God only knows
where you been since last December

Where you been with that twisted smile
throwing your mother in the pond
Break him easy when he go down for
the beauty of Wynona

Girls they skip double dutch
They saw you go, mama gone
Our prayers don't mean nothin' much
to the heart that cannot be won

Tangled in your fishing net
right here in my own bed
Drowning in the tears I shed for
the beauty of Wynona


<A NAME="mak"><h3>The Maker (Daniel Lanois)</h3></a>


Oh, oh deep water, black and cold like the night
I stand with arms wide open,
I've run a twisted line
I'm a stranger in the eyes of the Maker

I could not see for the fog in my eyes
I could not feel for the fear in my life
And from across the great divide, In the distance I saw a light
Jean Baptiste's walking to me with the Maker

My body is bent and broken by long and dangerous sleep
I can't work the fields of Abraham and turn my head away
I'm not a stranger in the hands of the Maker

Brother John, have you seen the homeless daughters
Standing there with broken wings
I have seen the flaming swords
there over east of eden

Burning in the eyes of the Maker
Burning in the eyes of the Maker
Burning in the eyes of the Maker...

Oh, river rise from your sleep...


<A NAME="bar"><h3>Bartender</h3></a>

And if I die
before my time
oh brother of mine
please don't forgive me if i die

and if i go
before i'm gone
oh sister of mine
please don't regret me if i go

Storms she come
and storms she go
please give me the wine
that Jesus drunk
to get him up the hill

Bartender please
pour me the wine
that you gave to Christ
to make him rise above
oh Bartender...

And then that means I fall
Bartender please....

And that means I pray
Bartender please....

And if I pray
those hearts are young
give me a second chance to fix it up
if I pray I break

And if I crush
my children's hears
please give me the strength
to fix them, Lord
if I crush

Bartender please
pour me a drink
the one you gave Christ
so that he might get up again
to live

Bartender please
pour me the wine
that you gave to Christ
get him out of the grave
please Bartender, wine...

On bended knees I pray
Bartender please....

Bartender please
on bended knees
God please....


<A NAME="blu"><h3>Blue Water Baboon Farm</h3></a>

Walking by the river's edge
Reach my hands to cup the sky
Run down my arms a bitter blue
Turn to red and the gashes grew

The river taste me
I'm so much more than I have ever been
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Take this my arms
Take this my eyes
Take this my mouth
And God it seems to be
Completely true
Oh, oh, oh, oh...yeah

Walking by the river's edge
Reach my hands to cup the sky
While on my arms a bitter blue
Turn to red and the grew

The river taste me
I'm so much more than I have ever been

<A NAME="dig"><h3>Digging A Ditch</h3></a>

I'm digging a ditch
Where madness lives
I'm digging a ditch
Where my silence lives
I'm diggin a ditch and when I am through
Digging this ditch I'll dig one for you
Digging a ditch 
As black as cold
Digging a ditch
Where I can hide my soul
Digging a ditch
Where my secrets stay

<A NAME="grc"><h3>Grace is Gone</h3></a>
I could never love again
So much as I love you
Where you end, where I begin
Is like a river running through 
Take my heart, take my eyes
I need them no more
If never again I fall upon the one I so adore
(Chorus)
Excuse me please, one more drink
Could you make it strong
Cause I don't need to think
She broke my heart
My grace is gone
Another drink and I'll be gone

<A NAME="gra"><h3>Granny </h3></a>

Hello, how are you doin' today?
I hope I find you feeling healthy
I'm so glad our paths crossed this time today
On our way into the night
I say its love, its hidin' deep, deep down inside us all
So maybe, we should lift it up above from a deep inside
Love, it's not so tough and you come admit it to a (?)
Baby, your heart into a thousand pieces dashed

Stop, only the old and wise, with clouded eyes
You can't see what I can, 'cause I
Blindly throw my faith to the face
of the next pretty girl to come my way.

Here we are all of us stand around
We're leaning heavy on each other
Always wonderin' what is it lies behind
The worried eyes of one another
I believe it's love, it's hidin there, in the shadows in the dark it's
Baby we'll shed a little light and it will shine
Love, when I approach, my tears they fall like rain
'Cause you know baby, my heart's into a thousand pieces dashed

Stop, only the old and wise, with clouded eyes
You can't see what I can, 'cause I
Blindly throw my faith to the face
Of the next good thing to come my way

I say it's love, so share it out, share it fair, but share it liberal
Maybe our thing's a better world than it could be love (?)
But love, when I approach, the tears they fall like rain
You tell me baby, your heart's into a thousand pieces dashed.

Stop, only the old and wise, with clouded eyes
You can't see what I can, I
Blindly throw my faith to the face
Of the next good thing to come my way

<A NAME="hea"><h3>Heathcliff's Haiku Warriors</h3></a>

My head won't leave me crying
And I lay this one
She won't give me happy 
As I lie here alone
My own will give you baby

Call again
Let me be the number
You lead me away again
It was anything I need to
Find my way through this sand (?)
My baby lead my head away
And calling by my head.

Boy
When you away we go
Sending me crawling back over 
And crawl back to say

My head, my head won't rely
On the troubles today
And my leave my head in worry
Like the summer rolls
My own won't leave me happy
Don't make me give it back
And on we will go

And have you called me there way before
And I leave this song with you
Feeling colder
than I ever have
She won't be my lady
And some of you fall

And I give you happy
Fools you know
My mind is wide and away
And for well it's gone
And only leave me happy
You wouldn't make me fall

And when we call
Maybe, baby say
And you call
I don't know again
Say too much...


<A NAME="lea"><h3>Leave Me Praying</h3></a>

Oh in excitement 
home that we call this
we charge with an eye on the line
and we go over
oh proud and strong
we come down on babies and mothers
and leave them to die
while we plant all over
and call it home

So weep at life
and leave me pray there
but still I should call it home
native soil
has anyone stolen land
and I love it like no other

And now my grandfather say
open your charge
you charge when the trumpet calls
blow on your flute 
pound on your drum
victory calls
oh no mother or child could
resist any strong beat
drive on west
we will plant we will grow

Wait and see my heart is bleeding
but still I should call it home
and teach my babies
my sons and my daughters
to love this place
and share it with no one

Then we started we ???? bounty
I will plant my wheat
I will hold my land here
I will protect my ones
I will protect my golden
I will stand up on top
and scream that I own land

But what if the spirit lies in this way
still should I call it home
and then I will tell
my sons and my daughters
to hold it so dear
and share it with all
then I will tell
my sons and my daughters 
to hold it so dear 
and share it with everyone

This land is your land 
this land is my land
from California to the New York islands
from the red wood forests
to the gulf stream waters
this land was made for you and me


<A NAME="peo"><h3>People, People</h3></a>

seven tumbling oceans surround the ground that I dance upon 
black and white and the rainbow, five colors in my eyes 
seven tumbling oceans surround the ground that I dance upon 
black and white and the rainbow, five colors in my eyes 

people, people 
what are we doing here 
oh, people 
what have we done with things 
people, people 
what are we doing here 
oh, people 
what have we done with things 

when we fight over the oceans? 
when we fight over the skies, and why? 
when we fight over our borders? 
then we, our brothers and sisters deny 

tell me why is it so cold in here 

seven tumbling oceans surround the ground that I dance upon 
black and white and the rainbow, five colors in my eyes 
when we stand in the mother's arms, no feeling of emptiness 
when we stand in the mother's hands, we can see that 
when we fight over the oceans 
when we fight over the skies, and why 
when we fight over our borders 
then we, our brothers and sisters deny 

tell me why do we do it 
why do we do it? oh, . . . 


<A NAME="dee"><h3>The Deed is Done</h3></a>

Oh so I pray
Oh at night
I wake up praying
all day light
I pray to you
and hear my request
I ask of you
to save this baby

O look at the girl
from inside
is cancer eaten
is life deprived
and if so by who
could it be you
I see no need
for a baby's wisdom for you

Oh god the girl 
all yellow turned
cheeks are swollen
and soul is burned

Oh but the girl
the girl is gone
and the deed is done
it must be wrong

Now I pray
my prayers not heard
could it be your death
death to mortal word

Oh and see her pain
and drain and drain
could you be deaf
and blind my friend
oh and so we hold
can you not hear
can you not see
and if with words
you could change the way
things are arranged
surely you'd be speaking
seeking no change

Oh but the girl
deaf dumb and blind
from the cancer burning
deep down inside
oh but the deed is done 
and the girl is gone
and I see no faith
that I have won

well you may find you're little
you may find your tracks
you may go
for me the girl is gone
Oh you may find you're attraction
to me the baby's gone


<A NAME="son"><h3>The Song That Jane Likes</h3></a>

And in plays to write the wire in
I'll come back again
Torching time talking rhymes in
I'll come back again

Would you like to play
With the thought of a friend
In a distant passing stage
While you lie around
With your hands up and out
So resigned you will fall down

While you around here play
Wild on the warm and far away
The days keep scribbling themselves
In tidy lines

Would you like to play
With a fool holding hands
With a one-eyed jack of spades

While on the deck they sing
All of the captain's cards are kings
Still he and the queen are lost at sea
I hope it isn't you and me

And I'll be back round again
Yes I'll walk in time with you old friend
And we'll find that place
That we had danced in so long ago

And in plays to write the wire in
I'll come back again
Torching time talking rhymes in
I'll come back again
With this resigned
The letter I sign 


<A NAME="tru"><h3>True Reflections</h3></a>

when you look into a mirror 
do you like what's looking at you 
now that you've seen your true reflections 
what on earth are you gonna do 

find some inspiration 
it's down deep inside of you 
amend your situation 
your whole life is ahead of you 
your whole life is ahead of you 

remember the time you hung out with the boys now 
remember the things you used to say 
I thought by now you'd be the president 
but after all that was yesterday 
you've had time to go out in the world now 
but you chose to run away 
people ask you what your doin' now 
you don't even know what to say 

you think life is like a movie 
where it all works out in the end 
I think life is like a dessert 
where does it go where does it begin 
when you look into a mirror 
do you like what's looking at you 
now that you've seen your true reflections 
what on earth are you gonna do 

find some inspiration 
it's down deep inside of you
