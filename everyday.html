<A NAME="idi"><h3>I Did It</h3></a>
I’m mixing up a bunch of magic stuff
A magic mushroom cloud of care
A potion that'll rock, the boat will rock
And make a bomb of love and blow it up

I did it
Do you think I’ve gone too far?
I did it
Guilty as charged
I did it
It was me right or wrong
I did it
Yeah

I never did a single thing that did a single thing
To change the ugly ways of the world
I didn’t know it felt so right inside
I didn’t know it all
I opened up the curtains
I heard sirens there, the lights flash and crawl
But I did it justice
I just did it for the buzz, oh

It’s a nickel or a dime for what I’ve done
The truth is that I don’t really care
For such a lovely crime I’ll do the time
You better lock me up I’ll do it again

I did it
Do you think I’ve gone too far?
I did it
Guilty as charged
I did it
It was me right or wrong
I did it
Yeah

I never did a single thing that did a single thing
To change the ugly ways of the world
I didn’t know it felt so right inside
I didn’t know it all
I open up the curtains
I heard sirens there, the lights flash and crawl
But I did it justice
I just did it for us all, you know

All you people are the skewers of our dreams
Like the cat that collared me:

Oh, what I gotta say to you
You got love
Don’t turn it down
Turn it loud
Let it build
We got a long way to go
But you, ya gotta start somewhere

Go door to door
Spread the love you got
You got the love
You get what you want
Does it matter where you get it from?
I for one
Don’t turn my cheek for anyone
Unturn your cheek to give your love
Love to grow

I did it
Do you think I’ve gone too far?
I did it
Guilty as charged
I did it
It was me right or wrong
I did it
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I did it
I told you, I told you I did
I did it
Guilty as charged
I did it
I told you, I told you I did
I did it
Yeah

I never did a single thing that did a single thing
To change the ugly ways of the world
I didn’t know it felt so right inside
I didn’t know it all
I open up the curtains
I heard sirens there, the lights flash and crawl
But I did it justice
I swear I did it for us all, you know


<A NAME="whe"><h3>When The World Ends</h3></a>
When the world ends
Collect your things
You’re coming with me
When the world ends
You tuckle up yourself with me
Watch it as the stars disappear to nothing
The day the world is over
We’ll be lying in bed

I’m gonna rock you like a baby when the cities fall
We will rise as the building’s crumble
Float there and watch it all
Amidst the burning, we’ll be churning
You know, love will be our wings
The passion rises up from the ashes
When the world ends

When the world ends
You’re gonna come with me
We’re going to be crazy
Like a river bends
We’re going to float
Through the criss cross of the mountains
Watch them fade to nothing
When the world ends
You know that’s what’s happening now
I’m going to be there with you somehow, oh...

I’m going to tie you up like a baby in a carriage car
Your legs won’t work cause you want me so
You just lie spread to the wall
The love you got is surely
All the love that I would ever need
I’m going to take you by my side
And love you tall, ‘til the world ends

Oh, but don’t you worry about a thing
No, 'cause I got you here with me
Don’t you worry about a
Just you and me
Floating through the empty, empty
Just you and me
Oh, graces
Oh, grace

Oh, when the world ends
We’ll be burning one
When the world ends
We’ll be sweet makin love
Oh, you know when the world ends
I’m going to take you aside and say
Let’s watch it fade away, fade away
And the world’s done
Ours just begun
It's done
Ours just begun

We’re gonna dive into the emptiness
We'll be swimming
I’m going to walk you through the pathless roads
I’m going to take you to the top of the mountain that’s no longer there
I’m going to take you to bed and love you, I swear
Like the end is here

I’m going to take you up to
I’m going to take you down on you
I’m going to hold you like an angel, angel

I’m going to love you
I’m going to love you
When the world ends
I’m going to hold you
When the world is over
We’ll just be beginning...


<A NAME="spa"><h3>The Space Between</h3></a>
You cannot quit me so quickly
Is no hope in you for me
No corner you could squeeze me
But I got all the time for you, love
The Space Between
The tears we cry
Is the laughter keeps us coming back for more
The Space Between
The wicked lies we tell
And hope to keep us safe from the pain

But will I hold you again?
These fickle, fuddled words confuse me
Like 'Will it rain today?'
Waste the hours with talking, talking
These twisted game we play

We're strange allies
With warring hearts
What wild-eyed beast you be
The Space Between
The wicked lies we tell
And hope to keep us safe from the pain

Will I hold you again?
Will I hold...

Look at us spinning out in
The madness of a roller coaster
You know you went off like a devil
In a church in the middle of a crowded room
All we can do, my love
Is hope we don't take this ship down

The Space Between
Where you're smiling high
Is where you'll find me if I get tickled
The Space Between
The bullets in our firefight
Is where I'll be hiding, waiting for you
The rain that falls
Splash in your heart
Ran like sadness down the window into...
The Space Between
Our wicked lies
Is where we hope to keep safe from pain

Take my hand
'Cause we're walking out of here
Oh, right out of here
Love is all we need here
The Space Between
What's wrong and right
Is where you'll find me hiding, waiting for you
The Space Between
Your heart and mine
Is the space we'll fill with time
The Space Between...


<A NAME="dre"><h3>Dreams of Our Fathers</h3></a>
Oh, I’m choking, I’m choking
On the smoke from this burning house
I claw and I scrape
But I can’t seem to get out
But who then, who is this
That’s scratching from the ground
Oh, it’s my world, too
But whose gold is this I’m digging out?

When we go, where we go
When we’re dead
Is the verdict still out?
Do we get into line
To line up with those long dead now?
With the muffled tears of sorrow
Bones underground
Is this time our time?
Yes, it is
Without or with this shadow of doubt

I don’t want to wake up
Lost in the Dreams of our Fathers
Oh, it’s such a waste child
To live and die for the Dreams of our Fathers
Though I must confess, yes
My view is a wonder about this
This love I possess, love
Must be the Dreams of our Fathers

I wanna go, I wanna run
We turn, so sure someone’s looking down
It’s haunting me, haunting me
Leaves us here to get out
Though I don’t believe, I don’t believe
This flavor in my mouth
Is from my tongue alone
So bitter I wanna spit it out

I repeat these words
They come out
Under the blue light in the sky
My empty pages are filling up
With these wicked lies
But I hear deep in myself
An echo, an echo
Of empty, empty emptiness
Comes up and swells inside

I don’t want to wake up
Lost in the Dreams of our Fathers
Oh, it’s such a waste child
To live and die for the Dreams of our Fathers
Though I must confess, yes
My view is a wonder about this
This love I possess, love
It must be the Dreams of our Fathers

Rain on my head
Rain on my head
Rain on me
And then give me air
Rain on my love
Again and again
Why can’t I dream you away from me?

Look here, look here
Bloated, floating
Go belly down
Belly up in the water
But who is this here that’s drowned?
We followed a drunken man
He got us all spinning round
But it’s like he swallowed himself
And didn’t leave us a way out

I don’t want to wake up
Lost in the Dreams of our Fathers
Oh, it’s such a shame child
To live and die for the Dreams of our Fathers
Though I must confess, yes
My view is a wonder about this
This love I possess, love
It must be the Dreams of our Fathers

This love I possess, love
It must be the Dreams of our Fathers
This love I possess, love
It must be the Dreams of our Fathers
This love I possess, love
It must be the love of our fathers

The dreams
The dreams
The dreams
This love I possess love


<A NAME="sor"><h3>So Right</h3></a>
Roll out down to midnight
Then roll on downtown 'til it's light
Because tomorrow we may die
Oh, but tonight we're dancing in the faint light
Don't you rob yourself of what you're feeling
Don't rob yourself of all that you could be
Roll hard 'til midnight
Roll 'til it's light

Come on now
Stay up and make some memories
Yeah, with us now
Roll the red carpet out with friends
To whom, to love and roll on

Our love is so right
I won't waste a minute here tonight
Our love is so right
And tonight my dance is all about you

To midnight love you,
Roll on and run the red lights
You know the game now is keep it tight

Oh, how I love your pretty rock-roll kisses
Come on and stay with me
Roll on and run the red lights
Come on, this love is so right

Stay up and make some memories
Yeah, with us now
To roll the red carpet out with friends
Oh, to love and roll on now

Our love is so right
I can taste
We're in it here tonight
Our love is so right
And tonight my dance
Is all about you

I'm going crazy
And it's all 'cause of you (it's all 'cause of you)
I'm going under, over you, over you...

This time is so alive
Everybody's tranced, dancing tonight
Oh so beautiful, and so strange
Oh, it was empty until you came...

Our love is so right
Forget the clouds that rain on your light
Our love is so right
I'll not forget how you look right now

Our love is so right
Remember let's just move together
Our love is so right
I swear it would last forever

Our love is so right
Forget the clouds that rain down on you
Our love is so right...


<A NAME="ifi"><h3>If I Had It All</h3></a>
Sometimes I can't move my feet it seems
As if I'm stuck in the ground somehow like a tree
As if I can't even breathe
Oh, and my screams come whispering out

As if nobody can even see me
Like a ghost, sometimes I can't see myself
Sometimes, then again, oh

If I were a king
If I had everything
If I had you and I could give you your dreams
If I were giant-sized, on top of it all
Then tell me what in the world would I sing for
If I had it all

Sometimes I feel lost
As I pull you out like strings of memories
Wish I could weave them into you
Then I could figure the whole damn puzzle out
Then again, oh

And if I were a king
If I had eveything
If I had you and I could give you your dreams
If I were giant-sized, on top of it all
Then tell me what in the world would I go on for
If I had it all

I could take anything
If I had no greed to bring
Only the poison that's tainting the clean
Oh, then nothing

Remembering times much younger than me now
When my breath was light
When the world raised me up kind

And here mother comforts child
Every moment was waking up
But now I've grown tired... out

If I had it all, you know
I'd fuck it up

If I were a king
If I had eveything
If I had you and I could give you your dreams
If I were giant-sized, on top of it all
Then tell me what in the world would I sing for...

If I were a king
If I had eveything, piece by piece
If I had you if i could give you your dreams
If I were giant-sized, on top of it all
Then tell me what in the world would I go on for
If I had it all
If I had it all

If I had it all


<A NAME="wha"><h3>What You Are</h3></a>
I walk into this room
Oh, all eyes on me now
But I do not know the people inside
They look straight through me, these eyes
Seeking more wisdom than I have to give away
Realize, realize what you are...

What you've become,
Just as I have
Are you and I so alike?
I don't hear you
Just as I am
Afraid if we dance we might die
Mock the world
Live safe, say why
Don't you know if you live life
Then you become what you are

The seasons sparing
We're all drifting away
Away from you
I pray for you now

Hoping to God on high
Is like clinging to straws
While drowning, oh
Realize, realize what you are...

What you've become
Just as I have
Are you and I so alike?
I don't hear you
Just as I am
Afraid if we dance we might die
Mock the world
Live safe, say why
Don't you know
When you live life
Then you become what you are

What you are
Is the beast in a lover's arms
What you are
Is the devil in the sweet, sweet kiss
What you are
Is missing a piece
What you are
Is a puzzle to me

What you've become
Just as I have
Are you and I so alike?
I don't hear you
Just as I am
Afraid if we dance we might die
What the world gives to you
Don't you know
When you give life
Then you become what you are?

Don't trust me
Trust you...
Up to you...
Trust you...


<A NAME="ang"><h3>Angel</h3></a>
I call you up
You pick up
You call my bluff
On the card to love
You hold too close
Your hands to your chest
I can read your eyes
But I confess
It's lonely far from you, oh

Even when you're right by me
It's only why I wait for you
To take my hand

Why do I beg like a child for your candy?
Why do I come after you like I do, I love you?
Wherever you are
I swear
You be my angel
You

I play my cards the best I can
But I lose my luck when you're not here
My darling heart
Won't you please give in?
I may be strong
But I want you back again

When you're not here it's hard to pretend
It's all alright again
When you're not here love it's hard to pretend
It's all alright but still
Why do I beg like a child for your candy?
Why do I run after you like I do, I love you?
Whatever you are
I swear
You be my angel, you

Watch the deck
Count your cards
Makes no sense
That I'm always losing
When you're gone

Why do I beg like a child for your candy?
Why do I come after you like I do, I love you
Whatever you are
I swear
You'll be my angel, you
When you're gone


<A NAME="foo"><h3>Fool to Think</h3></a>
Look at me dreaming of you
All I could hope is to have you
To have you walking with me
Laughing so in love, we two
Almost drunkenly
I did imbibe of this
Fantasy of you and me

Was I a fool to think?
The way you looked at me
I swear you did
But you looked away too quick
Was I a fool, was I a fool to think
That you would take me home
As if I was yours
Was I a fool to think at all?

I've grown tired of love
You are the trouble with me
I watch you walk right by
I smile, you do not notice me
Treat me recklessly
All you do is toss me pennies out
But the silence in me is screaming
Won't you come and get me?

Was I a fool to think?
The way you looked at me
I swear you did
But you looked away too quick
Was I a fool, was I a fool to think
That you would take me home
As if I was yours
Was I a fool to think at all?

Was I a fool to think?
The way you looked at me
I swear you did
But you looked away too quick
Was I a fool, was I a fool to think
That you would take me home
As if I was yours
Was I a fool to think at all?

You make a mess of me here
I dance a thousand steps for you
If you say yes to me
I'll be whatever gets you through

You make a mess of me here (was I a fool?)
I dance a thousand steps for you (was I a fool?)
Was I a fool, was I a fool to think?
Am I a fool, am I a fool for you?


<A NAME="sle"><h3>Sleep to Dream Her</h3></a>
I know I'll miss her later
Wish I could bend my love to hate her
Wish I could be her creator
To twist her arms now

She stares up at the stars when
The stars fell from her hair then
I bent down to collect them
And then she was gone

Oh, I sleep just to dream her
I beg the night just to see her
That my only love should be her
Just to lie in her arms

Oh, I came there to find out
Find out she'd made up her mind, oh
My arms are all tied up
To me she was blind

This space between us
Where wingless dreams fall earless
Will you not bear me witness
With your back to me now

It seemed so unnerving
Still somehow deserving
That she could hold my heart so tightly
And still not see me here, oh

Oh, I sleep just to dream her
Beg the night just to see her
That my only love should be her
Just to lie in her arms

I know I'll miss her later
Wish I could bend my love to hate her
Wish I could be her creator
To be the light in her eyes



<A NAME="mot"><h3>Mother, Father</h3></a>
Mother, father please explain to me
Why a world so full of mystery
A place so bitter and still so sweet
So beautiful and yet so full of sad, sad...

Mother, father please explain to me
Why forests march to desert speed
While snowcapped mountains melt away
What do we tell our babies, when do we say, oh

Mother, father please explain to me
How a man who rocks his child to sleep
Pulls the trigger on his brother's heart
He digs a hole right to the middle of this storm of hatred

Mother, father please explain to me
How it could be so this world has come to be
A precious balance in between
Such cruelty and such kindness please

Mother, father please explain to me
How this world has come to be
Unequaled in her blessings, oh, I see
Unbridled hatred so extreme, please tell me

Mother, father please explain to me
How this world has come to be so
Twisted between time and dreams
Oh, mother, father please explain to me
Oh, what's all this talk about?
All this talk about it
Spinning down, down, down, down, down
All this talk about
Endless words without
Nothing's done

Mother, father do you know
Why one man's belly overflows
Another sleeps in hunger's bed
Oh, we trade our world for a piece of bread

Oh Mother, father please explain to me
How this rare world's come to be
A place so full of color yet overflowing
Always in black and white
Drowning in the waters of our...

Mother, father please explain to me
How this world has come to be
While still blessed in all the things we see
Such a sad, sad home for you and me

Come out, and hold,
Come on out you
Come on out you
Come and save yourself

Come on out you
Come on we're taking the water
We're taken the water
We're taken the water
But you know
We got the freedom
We got the freedom

There's no God above
And no hell below
Oh, it's here with us
It's up to us
To keep afloat

How this sweet world has come to be
Oh to keep afloat

Mother, father please explain to me
How this rare world has come to be
Oh, let the blue planet
Let the blue planet

Mother, father please explain to me
Mother, father please explain
