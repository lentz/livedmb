Recently

Recently I've been 
All of content and dreaming I have been 
'Cause I been lately seeing 
Quite a bit of this woman live on my street 

People stare and we just ignore everything 
People stare and we just ignore them 
And they go away, go away 

She comes to me 
I watch her drink 
I watch her comb her hair 
Both say that we never before have 
Recently

Felt as recently 

People stare and we just ignore 
What's the use in hiding out 
She says all the time 
Let their eyes do the worrying about 

She and me go to places quiet 
Where we are quite alone 
Kiss and we hold together 
We will be until we done 

People stare and we just ignore 
What's the use in hiding out 
She says all the time 
Let their eyes do the worring about 

Both say the we never before 
Never before have felt as recently 
People stare and we just ignore everything 
People stare and we just ignore them 
And they go away, go away 


  
<A NAME="dan"><h3>Dancing Nancies</h3></a>  
 

Could I have been 
A parking lot attendant 
Could I have been 
A millionaire in Bel Air 
Could I have been Lost somewhere in Paris 
Could I have been 
Your little brother 
Could I have been 
Anyone other than me 
Could I have been 
Anyone other than me 
Could I have been 
Anyone other than me 
Could I have been 
Anyone 

He stands touch his hair his shoes untied 
Tongue gaping stare 
Could I have been a magnet for money? 
Could I have been anyone other than me? 

Twenty three and so tired of life 
Such a shame to throw it all away 
The images grow darker still 
Could I have been anyone other than me? Then I 

Look up at the sky 
My mouth is open wide, lick and taste 
What's the use in worrying, what's the use in hurrying 
Turn, turn we almost become dizzy 

Iam who I am who I am who am I 
Requesting some enlightenment 
Could I have been anyone other than me? 

Sing and dance I'll play for you tonight 
And thrill at it all 
Dark clouds may hang on me sometimes 
But I'll work it out then I 

Look up at the sky 
My mouth is open wide, lick and taste 
What's the use in worrying, what's the use in hurrying 
Turn, turn we almost become dizzy 

Falling out of a world of lies 
Could I have been dancing nancy 
Could I have been anyone other than me? 



<A NAME="war"><h3>Warehouse</h3></a>

Hey reckless mind 
Don't throw away your playful beggining 
You and I let us fumble around in the touches 
And be sure to 

Leave all the lights on 
So I can see the black cat changing colors 
And walk under ladders 
And travel my eyes over you 

Hey we have found 
Becoming one in a million 
Slip into the crowd 
This question I found in the gap in the sidewalk 

Keep all your sights on 
The black cat changing colors 
I can walk under ladders 
And swim as the tides choose to turn me 

And here I sit 
Life goes on, end of tunnel, TV set 
Spot in the middle 
Static fade, statistic bit 
And soon I fade away, fade away 

This I admit 
Taste so good, hard to believe an end to it 
Smell touch feel 
How could this rhythm ever quit 
Bags packed on a plane 
Hopefully to heaven 

Shut up I'm thinking 
I had a clue now it's gone forever 
Sitting over these bones 
You can read in whatever you're needing to 

Keep all your sights on 
The big bad black cat that's 
Changing colors 

It's not the colors that matter 
But that they'll all fade away 

This I admit 
Seems so full 
Hard to believe an end to it 
Warehouse is bare 
Nothing at all inside of it 
Walls and halls have disappeared 

My love I love to stay here 
In the warehouse



<A NAME="all"><h3>All Along the Watchtower</h3></a>

There must be some way out of here,
Said the joker to the thief.
There's too much confusion
I can't get no relief

Business men they,
drink my wine.
There plowmen dig my earth.
None of them along the line
know what any of it's worth.

No reason to get excited,
the thief he kindly spoke.
There are many among us,
who feel that life is but a joke (Ha Ha- Ha ha)

But you and I we've been through all that,(Yes we have)
and this is not our fate.
So let us not talk falsely,
the hour is getting late

And All along the Watchtower,
prince's kept the view.
While all the women all the women all the women came and went
Barefoot servants too.
Out side in the cold distance, 
a wild cat did growl la la la la la
Two riders two riders approaching,
the wind began to howl

The thief he take
my money take
The thief he take 
my money take

Am I insane
Auf Wiedersehen
Am I insane
The thief is safe

NO REASON TO GET EXCITED! (YEAH!....)



<A NAME="hall"><h3>Halloween</h3></a>

Lonely two chicken eyes open and staring up at me 
Only two lonely eyes, so rare and raging...
Wind it would a come and she would leave you 
Wind it would a come and she would go 
Wind it would a come and she would leave you 
Wind it would a come and she would go 

Watchit man, leave it where you lie 
I come for you, a-lightly, I suck up into your mind 
We'll leaveit all behind I selling you a lonely, I 
march up into your eyes 

Lonely two chicken eyes 
Open and staring up at me... 
Wait until my momma gonna see me with a you 
Take a good look, momma, gonna see me with a you 
Take a good look, mama, let me tell you well my momma said "Lie..." 

Hey man watch it where you lie, i come into your psyche
You're sleeping - I'm in your mind filled waiting on desire 
I was hoping we'd be lonely 
I suck up into your...

Why do you run around here 
To ask why do you run around me 
To ask why do you run around here 
Ask why, then, why, then, 
ask you silly fuck 

I'm going away 
Why this lonely, why this lonely 
Why this lonely love 
Why this lonely, why this lonely 
Why this lonely love for me...
Carry on, carry on, carry on 
Carry on, carry on, carry on I will forget 
Tell me are you satisfied with fucking? 
Don't walk awayx3 I'm talking to... 
Lovey don't 
Lovey dove (3x) 
Loving, I'll see you 
Love, love, love 
Love him, I see you 
Love, Love, love 
Love him - up to you. 
[drum solo] 
Lonely love...
