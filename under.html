<A NAME="bes"><h3>The Best of What's Around</h3></a>

hey my freind 
it seems your eyes are troubled 
care to share your time with me 
would you say you're feeling low and so 
a good idea would be to get it off your mind 
see, you and me 
have a better time than most can dream 
have it better than the best 
so can pull on through 
whatever tears at us 
whatever holds us down 
and if nothing can be done 
we'll make the best of what's around 

turns out not where but who you're with 
that really matters 
and hurts not much when you're around 
and if you hold on tight 
to what you think is your thing 
you may find you're missing all the rest 
well she run up into the light suprised 
her arms are open 
her mind's eye is 

seeing things from a 
better side than most can dream 
on a clearer road i feel 
oh you could say she's safe 
whatever tears at her 
whatever holds her down 
and if nothing can be done 
she'll make the best of what's around 



<A NAME="wha"><h3>What Would You Say</a></h3>
  
up and down the puppies' hair 
fleas and ticks jump everywhere 
'cause of original sin 
down the hill fell jack and jill 
and you came tumbling after 
'cause of original sin 

rip away the tears 
drink a hope to happy years 
and you may find 
a lifetime's passed you by 
what would you say 
don't drop the big one 
if you a monkey on a string 
don't cut my lifeline 
if you a doggie on a chain 
don't bite the mailman 
what would you say 

i was there when the bear 
ate his head, thought it was a candy 
everyone goes in the end 
knock knock on the door 
who's it for, there's nobody in here 
look in the mirror my freind 

i don't understand at best 
and connot speak for all the rest 
the morning rise a lifetime's passed me by 

every dog has its day every day has its way 
of being forgotten 
mom it's my birthday 
what would you say 



<A NAME="sat"><h3>Satellite</h3></a>
  
satellite in my eyes 
like a diamond in the sky 
how i wonder 
satellite strung from the moon 
and the world your balloon 
peeping tom for the mother station 

winter's cold spring erases 
and the calm away by the storm is chasen 
everything good needs replacing 
look up, look down all around, hey satellite 

satellite headlines read 
someone's secrets you've seen 
eyes and ears have been 
satellite dish in my yard 
tell me more, tell me more 
who's the king of your satellite castle? 

winter's cold spring erases 
rest high above the cloud; no restriction 
television we bounce 'roudn the world 
and while i spend these hours five senses reeling 
i laugh about this wetherman's satellite eyes 



<A NAME="rhy"><h3>Rhyme & Reason</h3></a>
  
Oh well oh well so here we stand 
but we stand for nothing 
my heart calls to me in my sleep 
how can i turn to it 
'cause i'm all locked up in this 
dark place-- 
and i do not know i'm as good as dead 
my head aches-- 
warped and tied up i need to kill this pain 

my head won't leave my head alone 
and i don't believe it will 
until i'm dead and gone 
my head won't leave my head alone 
and i don't believe it willl 
until i'm six feet under gound 

how long i'm tied up 
my mind in knots-- 
my stomach reels in concern for what i might do or 
what i've done 
it's got me living in fear 
well i know these voices must 
be my sould i've had my grave 
lying wired and shut and quiet in my grave 
leave me here 
leave it to me to waste here 
so young and here i am again 
talking to myself 
a tv blares 
oh man 
oh how i wish i didn't smoke 
or drink to reason with my head 
but sometimes this thick confusion 
grows utnil i cannot bear it all 
needle to the vein 
needle to the vein 
take this needle from my vein my fiend 
i said 
in my grave 
lying, lying cold in my grave 
the reason--my reason 
take my head off this terror 
the fearing won't come back 
i can't see my mind's all wiped clean 
the needle 
make my great escape 
i seem caught in time 
my head leaves me behing 
body fall cold 
and i have seen heaven 



<A NAME="typ"><h3>Typical Situation</h3></a>
  
ten fingers we have each 
nine planets around the sun repeat 
eight ball is the last if you triumphant be 
seven oceans pummel the shores of the sea 
it's a typical situation 
in the typical times 
too many choices 

everybody's happy 
everybody's free 
we'l keep the big door open 
everyone'll come around 
why are you different 
why are you that way 
if you don't get in line 
we'll lock you away 

it all comes down to nothing 

six senses feeling 
five around a sense of self 
four season turn on and turn off 
i can see 
three corners from this corner 
two is a perfect number 
but one 

everybody's happy 
everybody's free 
we'll keep the big door open 
and everyone'll come around 
why are you different 
why areyou that way 
if you don't step in line 
we'll lock you away 

it's a typical situation 
in these typical times 
we can't do thing about it 



<A NAME="dan"><h3>Dancing Nancies</h3></a>
  
could i have been 
a parking lot attendant 
could i have been 
a millionaire in bel air 
could i have been 
lost somewhere in paris 
could i have been 
your little brother 
could i have been anyone other than me 
could i have been oh, anyone other than me 
could i have been anyone 

he stands touch his hair his shoes untied 
tongue gaping stare 
could i have been a magnet for money 
could i have been anyone other than me 
twenty three 
i'm so tired of life 
such a shame to throw it all away 
the images grow darker still 
could i have been anyone other then me? 

then i 
look up at the sky 
my mouth is open wide, like and taste 
what's the use in worrying, what's the use in hurrying 
turn turn we almost become dizzy 

i am who i am who i am well who am i 
requesting some enlightenment 
could i have been anyone other than me? 

and then i'll 
sing and dance and i'll play for you tonight 
the thrill of it all 
dark clouds may hang on me sometimes 
but i'll work it out 
and then i 

falling out of a world of lies 
could i have been dancing nancy 
dancing nancy 
could i have been anyone other than me? 



<A NAME="ant"><h3>Ants Marching</h3></a>
  
he wakes up in the morning 
does his teeth bite to eat and he's rolling 
never changes a thing 
the weeke ends the week begins 
she thinks, we look at each other 
wondering what the other is thinking 
but we nver say a thing 
and these crimes between us grow deeper 

take these chances 
place them in a box until a quieter time 
lights down, you up and die 

goes to visit his mommy 
she feeds him well his concerns he forets them 
and remembers being small 
playing under the table and dreaming 

driving along on this highway 
all these cars and upon the sidewalk 
people in every direction 
no words exchanged, no time to exchange and when 
all the little ants are marching 
red and black antennae waving 
they all do it the same 
they all do it the same way 

candyman tempting the thoughts of a 
sweet tooth tortured by weit loss 
program cutting the ocrners 
loose end, loose end cut cut 
on the fence, not to offend 
cut cut cut cut 

take these chances 
place them in a box until a quieter time 
lights down you up and die 
lights down you up and die 



<A NAME="lov"><h3>Lover Lay Down</h3></a>

spring sweet rhythm dance in my head 
slip into my lover's hands 
kiss me won't you kiss me now 
and sleep i would inside yoru mouth 
don't be us too shy 
knowing it's no big surprise 
that i will wait for you 
i will wait for no one but you 
oh please lover lay down 
spend this time with me 
together share this smile 
lover lay down 
spend this time with me 

walk with me, walk with you 
hold my hands your hands 
so much we have dreamed 
and you were so much younger 
hard to explain that we are stronger 

a million reasons life to deny 
let's toss them away 
see you and me we 
lay down look see 
she and he 
by my lover's side 
together share this smile 
lover lay down 
oh please oh please 
please lover lay down 
oh please lover lay down 
and you weep lover lay down 
cause it's over lover lay down 
say love, say love, say love, say love, say love 
could i love you 
could you love me 
darling it's all the same 
'til we dance away 
chasing me all around 
leading me all around 
leading me all around in circles 

say....... 



<A NAME="jim"><h3>Jimi Thing</h3></a>
  
lately i've been feeling low 
a rememdy is what i'm seeking 
i take a taste of what's below 
come away to something better 
what i want is what i've not got 
but what i need is all around me 
reaching seraching never stop 
and i'll say.... 

if you could keep me floating just for a while 
'til i get to the end of this tunnel...mommy 
if you could keep me floating just for a while 
i'll get back to you 

sometimes a jimi thing slides my and keeps me swingin' 
i'd like to show you what's inside 
i shouldn't care if you do or don't like it 
brother chaos rule all about 
sometimes i wlak there 
well yes, god knows, sometimes i take a bus there 
shouldn't care i shouldn't care bereaved as i'm feeling 

the day is gone i'm on my back 
string up at the ceiling 
i take a drink sit back relax 
smaoke my mind make me feel 
better for a small time 
what i want is what i've not got 
and what i need is all aorund me 
reaching searching never stop 
and i'll say... 

if you could keep me floating just for a while 
'til i get to the end of the tunnel... mommy 
if you could keep me floating just for a while 
i'll get back to you 



<A NAME="war"><h3>Warehouse</h3></a>
  
see i'm leaving 
this warehouse frightens me 
has me tied up in knots 
can't rest for a moment 
soom i'm going i'm slippin' slow away 
hoping to find something better than 
i've got inside of here 
the warehouse slips away 

hey reckless mind 
don't throw away your playful beginning 
you and i will fumble around in the touches 
and be sure to 
leave all the lights on 
so we can see the black cat changing colors 
and we can walk under the ladders 
and swim as the tide turns you around and around 

hey we have found 
becoming one in a million 
slip into the crowd 
this question if found in a gap in the sidewalk 
keep al lyour sights on 
he the black cat changing colors 
and you can walk under ladders 
and swim as the tide choose to turn you 
and here is it 

life goes on, end of tunnel, tv set 
spot in the middle 
state fade, statistical bit 
and soon i'll fade away, i'll fade away 
this i admit 
taste so good, hard to believe an end to it 
smell touch feel 
how could this rhythm ever quit 
bags packed on a plane 
hopefully to heaven 

shut up i'm thinking 
i had a clue now it's gone forever 
sitting over these bones 
you can read in whatever you're needing to 
keep all your sights on 
yeah man, the black cat 
changing colors 
when it's not the colors that matter 
but that they'll all fade away 

this i admit 
seems so good 
hard to believe an end to it 
warehouse is bare 
nothing at all inside of it 
walls and halls have disappeared 

my love i love to stay here 
my love i love to stay here 
in a corner was wondering 
if a change could be better than this 
and then i worry 
maybe things won't be better than they have been 
here in the warehouse 
at the warehouse 
how i love to stay here 
at the warehouse 
every man and woman 
get alive 
that's our blood down there 
seems poured from the hands of angels 
but trickle into the ground 
leaves the warehouse bare and empty 
my heart's numbered beat 
still echoe in this empty room 
fear wells in me 
but nothing seems enough to defend 
so i am going away 



<A NAME="pay"><h3>Pay For What You Get</h3></a>
  
work ourselves, fingers to the bone 
suck the morrow, drain my sould 
pay your dues, and your debts 
pay your repects, everybody tells you 
you pay for what you get

everybody asks me how she's doing 
has she really lost her mind? 
i said, i couldn't tell you i've lost mine 

words, words, words have you heard 
a bird in hand is much better than, 
any number free to wander 
fly away... 
stay 
you pay for what you get 
you pay for what you get 

everybody asks me how she's doing 
has she really lost her... 
everybody asks me how she's doing 
since she went away 
i said i couldn't tell 
i'm okay 

i'm okay 
i'm okay, how are you? 

pay for what you get... 
pay for what you get...oh... 
pay for what you get... 
pay for what you get...
