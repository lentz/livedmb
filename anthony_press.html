CHRISTIAN ANTHONY TO PERFORM AT HOUSTON DAVE MATTHEWS BAND SHOWS<br></b></class>
<br>
<p class="text">
Bent Antenna recording artist Christian Anthony will be performing at two
Dave Matthews Band shows at the Woodlands Pavilion in Houston next month. 
The shows will take place on September 12 and 13 at 6pm as part of the
Levis 
First Stage Series.  Opening on the main stage will be Bela Fleck and the
Flecktones at 7pm.<br><br></class>
<p class="text">
Christian recently wrapped up an 18 month tour of both the US and Europe
in 
support of the debut CD "naked and alive."  During that time he has been a
featured showcase artist at the EAT'M conference in Las Vegas and the
LMNOP 
festival in New Orleans.  The debut album "naked and alive" is currently
getti
ng radio-play on AAA stations around the country and was voted one of the
top 
25 best cd’s of 1999 by cdbaby.com customers.  Select tracks from the
album 
have charted as high as #1 on Soundclick.com and #2 at MP3.com in recent
months.  "Naked and alive" is available nationally at both traditional
retail 
outlets and via most e-commerce sites.<br><br></class>
<p class="text">
Sarah Bardeen of listen.com says, Bold strokes of clever lyricism and 
earthy, contemplative vocals paint themselves on a rock 'n' roll canvas
with 
indelible ink.  At times huge, at times humorous, Anthony's
neo-flower-child 
sensibility won't escape comparisons to the Dave Matthews Band.
Dan Kimpel of Music Connection writes, The raw edges of Christian
Anthony’s 
songs are organic and revealing.  This is the real deal: songs so natural
they may have written themselves. 
Carol White of the Pacifican says, Fabulous.  Phenomenal.  Spectacular. 
Breathtaking.  Unbelievable.  He has the look, the sound and the talent. 
Sometime in the near future, Christian Anthony is going to be the
beginning 
of a new craze of solo male performers.<br><br></class>
