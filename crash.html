<A NAME="let"><h3>Let You Down</h3></a>

I let you down 
Let me pick you up 
I let you down 
Let me climb up you to the top 
So I can see the view from up there 
Tangled in your hair 
I let you down 
I have no lid upon my head 
But if i did 
You could look inside and see 
What's on my mind 
I let you down, oh, forgive me 
You give me love 
Let me walk with you, maybe I could say 
Maybe talk with you, open up 
And let me through 
Don't walk away 
Don't walk away 
I have no lid upon my head 
But if I did 
You could look inside and see what's on my mind 
You could look inside and see what's on my mind 
I let you down 
How could I be such a fool like me 
I let you down 
Tail between my legs 
I'm a puppy for you love 
I'm a puppy for you love 
I have no lid upone my head 
but if i did 
you could look inside and see 
whats on my mind , oh its you 
I let you down 
I'm a puppy for your love 
I'm a puppy for your love 
Forgive me 
Forgive me 
Forgive me 
I let you down  




<A NAME="crash"><h3>Crash Into Me</h3></a>

You've got your ball 
you've got your chain 
tied to me tight tie me up again 
who's got their claws 
in you my friend 
Into your heart I'll beat again 
Sweet like candy to my soul 
Sweet you rock 
and sweet you roll 
Lost for you I'm so lost for you 
You come crash into me 
And I come into you 
I come into you 
In a boys dream 
In a boys dream 

Touch your lips just so I know 
In your eyes, love, it glows so 
I'm bare boned and crazy for you 
When you come crash 
into me, baby 
And I come into you 
In a boys dream 
In a boys dream 

If I've gone overboard 
Then I'm begging you 
to forgive me 
in my haste 
When I'mb holding you so girl 
close to me 

Oh and you come crash 
into me, baby 
And I come into you 
Hike up your skirt a little more 
and show the world to me 
Hike up your skirt a little more 
and show your world to me 
In a boys dream.. In a boys dream 

Oh I watch you there 
through the window 
And I stare at you 
You wear nothing but you 
wear it so well 
tied up and twisted 
the way i'd like to be 
For you, for me, come crash 
into me 




<A NAME="toomuch"><h3>Too Much</h3></a>

Straight in. suck up and go, 
cool it, swallow, swallow 
Breathe deep, take it all 
it comes cheap 
Push it through the doors 
because in between the lines 
I'm gonna pack more lines 
so I can get in 
Ooh traffic jam got more can 
than a beach got sand 
Suck it up suck it up suck it up 
fill it up until no more 
I'm no crazy creep, i've got it coming 
to me because I'm not satisfied 
The hunger keeps on growing 

I eat too much 
I drink too much 
I want too much 
Too much 

I've got to get it somewhere 
I mean, you never know, maybe 
you're dreaming 
Who do you think you're watching 
Who do you think you need 
Play for me, play more. 
ten times in the same day 
I need more. I'm going 
over my borders 
I'm going to take more, more 
from you, letter by letter 

I eat too much 
I drink too much 
I want too much 
Too much 

I told,god. I'm coming 
to your country 
I'm going to eat up your cities. 
your homes, you know 
I've got a stomach full it's not 
a chip on my shoulder 
I've got this growl in my tummy 
and I'm gonna stop it today 
I eat too much 
I drink too much 
I want too much 
Too much 

Suck it up... 




<A NAME="41"><h3>#41</h3></a>

Come and see 
I swear by now I'm playing time 
I against my troubles 
I'm coming slow but speeding 
Do you wish a dance and while I'm 
in the front 
the play on time is won 
but the difficulty is coming here 
I will go in this way 
And find my own way out 
I wont tell you to stay 
But I'm coming to much more 
Me 
All at once the ghosts come back 
Reeling in you now 
What if they came down crushing 
Remember when I used to play for 
all of the loneliness that nobody 
notice now 
I'm begging slow I'm coming here 
Only waiting I wanted to stay 
I wanted to play 
I wanted to love you 

I'm only this far 
And only tomorrow leads my way 

I'm coming waltzing back and moving into your head 
Please, I wouldnt pass this by 
I would take any more than 
What sort of man goes by 
I will bring water 
Why wont you ever be glad 
It melts into wonder 
I came in praying for you 
why wont you run 
in the rain and play 
let the tears splash all over you 




<A NAME="cry"><h3>Cry Freedom</h3></a>
  
how can i turn away 
brother sister go dancing through my head 
human as to human 
the future is no place 
to place your better days 

cry freedom cry 
from a crowd ten thousand wide 
(hopelessly hope) 
that this crowd will not subside 
let this flag burn to dust 
and in you our filled design is raised 
while you wait head and hands hands in prayer 
and fall into a dreamless sleep again 
and you wait 
and hands and feet are all allied 
but wall between divide us 
hands and feet are all allied 
but gold between divided souls slip away 

there was a window and by it stood 
a meadow in which he could see himself 
he thought of something 
something he had never had 
but hoped would come had gone 

cry freedom cry 
from a crowd ten thousand wide 
while you wait 
hands and feet are all allied 
but gold between divide us 
hands and feet are allied 
but walls between divided soul slip away 

in this room stood a little child 
and in this room this little child he would remain 
until someone might decide 
to dance this little child across this 
into a cold dark space 
where she might never trace away 
across this crooked mile 
across this crooked page 

cry freedom cry 
from deep inside 
where we are all confined 
and you wait there 

how can i turn away 
brother sister go dancing through my head 
human as to human 
the future is no place 
to place your better days 

hands and feet are all allied 
but gold between divide us 
hands and feet are all allied 
but worlds between divide us 
hands and feet are all allied 
but faith between divide us 
hands and feet are all allied 
but walls between divide us 
hands and feet save the life 
hear what i say hear what i say 

how can i turn away 
brother sister go dancing through my head 
human as to human 
the future is no place 
to place your better days

Georgia Theater, 4-5-94 

you walk into my days 
love against me hold 
and this no better have i felt 
oh no my love, you drive me wild 

hey the wine's so sweet 
so senses blind 
? 
oh stolen heart 
and so by you 

say the sweetest wine 
could never quench me like 
your love 
and hold it close so well 
where reason ??? 

"Step into the Light" 12.31.95 NYE 

you came to me like wine 
thumbs to their mouths 
grown tired of water all the time 
oh quench my love 
you quench my mind 

say hello i came to implore 
? 
hold me and this i must escape 
hold me lay you oh, lightly shine 

you hello ____ every hour 
lead me back to you 
and this i must admit 
our shower of falling rays 

Hampton Colleseum 12-31-95 

you drive me to distraction 




<A NAME="tripping"><h3>Tripping Billies</h3></a>

we were above 
you standing underneath us 
we were not yet lovers 
dragons were smoked 
bumblebees were stinging us 
i was soon to be crazy 
eat, drink and be merry 
for tomorrow we die 
'cause we're tripping billies 

we're wearing nothing 
nothing but out shadows 
shadows falling down on the beach sand 
remembering once, 
out on the beaches we wore 
pineapple grass bracelets 

so why would you care 
to get out of this place 
you and me and all our freinds 
such a happy human race 
'cause we're tripping billies 

we are all sitting 
legs crossed round a fire 
my yellow flame she dances 
tequila drinking oh our 
minds will wonder 
to wonderous places 

so why would you care 
to get out of this place 
you and me and all our friends 
such a happy human race 

eat, drink and be merry 
for tomorrow we die 




<A NAME="monkey"><h3>Proudest Monkey</h3></a>

Sweet enough in my tree 
Oh well I bounce around 
Branch to branch 
Landed in His tree 
all in a day's dream 
The other monkeys 
beat the other monkey's head 
Me I am a humble monkey 
Sitting up in my tree again 
But then comes a day 
When I came down from these safe limbs 
I turned I turned away 
walking tall... 
and I up and singing 

I went to the city 
car horns, corners, and gritty 
Now I am I am the proudest monkey 
You ever seen 
Monkey see Monkey do, Yeah 

-SAX 

Then came a day 
Staring at myself in my reflection there 
I wonder do I want the simple so-called things 
that I knew when I sat up in my branches dreaming 
I know these were easy days 
Nuts and Bugs and Berries were my way to pay the way 
Now I am I am the proudest monkey 
You ever seen 
Monkey see Monkey do, Yeah 

-SAX
