<A NAME="pan"><h3>Pantala Naga Pampa</h3></a>
Come and relax now 
Put your troubles down 
No need to bear the weight of your worries 
You let them all fall away 

<A NAME="pig"><h3>Pig</h3></a> 

Oh isn't it strange, 
How we move our lives for another day 
like skipping a beat 
But if a great wave should wash us all the way 
just thinking out loud 
don't mean to dwell on this dying thing 
but look at my love 
It's alive right now 
Deep outside sweet within 
Pouring through our veins 
Intoxicate moving wine to tears and drinking 
And in the evening spend dancing you and me 

OH 

this love will open our world 
from the dark side we can see the glow of something right 
oh there's much more we can see here 

Don't burn the day away 
Don't burn the day 
Don't burn the day away 

Is this not enough? 
this blessed sip of life is it not enough 
Staring down at the ground 
Or then complain and pray for more from above 
You greedy little thing 
Stop just what your world ticking away 
I'd jump problem now 
and all be dead and gone in a few short years 

OH 

Just love will open our eyes 
Just love will put the hope back in our minds 
Much more then we could ever know oh so 

Don't burn the day 
Away 
Don't burn the day 
Away 

Come sister, my brother 
Shake up your bones, shake up your feet 
I'm saying, open up 
And let the rain come pouring in 
Watch out this high notion 
All that the best is yet to come 
In all while your dancing on the ground 
Don't think of oh when your done 

Love (love) 
Love (love) 
Love (love) 
What more is this? 
Cause we need the light of love in here 
Don't beat your head 
Dry your eyes 
Let the love in there 
There's been times 
But that's ok 
Just look the love in there 

And don't burn the day 
Away 

Look here I will weap 
on this starry night staring into space 
And I must say 
I feel as small as dust lying down here 

What point could I be traveling? 
Head down wondering what would become of me 
Why can't sun, we cannot see 
But no reason to abandon it 
The kindness, your time that's alright 
Maybe I'll go out in the middle of the night 
And take your hand from your eyes my love 
All good things must come to an end sometime 

But don't burn the day 
Away 
Don't burn the day 
Away 

Come sister, my brother 
Shake up your bones, shake up your feet 
I'm saying, open up 
And let the rain come pouring in 
Watch out this high notion 
All that the best is yet to come 
But all while your dancing on the ground 
Don't think of when your gone 

Love (love) 
Love (love) 
Love (love) 
What more is this? 
Cause we, need the light of love in here 
Don't beat your head 
Dry your eyes 
Let the love in there 
The bad times 
Well That's ok 
Just look the love in here 

yeah! 

Just let the love in here 



<A NAME="sto"><h3>The Stone</h3></a>

I've this creeping 
Suspicion that things are not 
 as they seem 
 Reassure me 
Why do I feel as if I'm in too deep 
 I've been praying 
For some way to show them 
 I'm not what they see 
Yes I have done wrong 
But what I did I thought 
needed be done 
I swear 
Unholy day 
If I leave now I might get away 
This weighs on me 
As heavy as stone and as blue as I go 
I was just wondering if 
 you'd come along 
To hold up my head when my head 
 won't hold on 
 I'll do the same if the same's 
what you want 
If not I'll go 
I will go alone 
I'm a long way 
From that fool's mistake and 
now forever pay 
No, run 
I will run and I'll be ok 
 I was just wondering if 
 you'd come along 
To hold up my head when my head 
won't hold on 
I'll do the same if the same's 
what you want 
 If not I'll go 
 I will go alone 
I need so 
To stay in your arms, see you smile, hold you close 
 And it weighs on me 
As heavy as stone and 
a bone chilling cold 
I was just wondering if 
 you'd come along 
Tell me you will 



<A NAME="las"><h3>The Last Stop</h3></a>

Fire 
The sun is well asleep 
Moon is high above 
 Fire grows from the east 
 How is this 
 Hate so deep 
Lead us all so blindly killing killing 
Fools we are 
 If hate's the gate to peace 
  This is the last stop 
For raining tears 
    War 
  The only way to Peace 
 I don't fall for that 
Raining tears 
You're righteous, so righteous 
You're always so right 
Go ahead and dream 
Go ahead believe that you are the chosen one 
Raining tears 
Oh no 
 Gracious even God 
Bloodied the cross 
Your sins are washed enough 
Mother's cry 
"Is hate so deep 
  Must a baby's bones 
 This hungry fire feed?" 
 As smoke clouds roll in 
The symphony of death 
This is the last stop 
  Scream 
Right is wrong now 
 Shut up you big lie 
This black and white lie 
You comb your hair to hide 
Your lying eyes 
You're righteous, so righteous 
You're always so right 
 But why your lie 
Go ahead and dream 
Go ahead believe that you are the chosen one 
This is the last stop 
Here there's more than is showing up 
Hope that we can break it down 
It's not so black and white 
You're righteous 
You're righteous 
You're righteous 
You're always so right 
There you are nailing a good tree 
   Then say forgive me, forgive me 
  Why 
Raining tears 
This is the last stop 
 Here there is more than is showing up 
Hope that we can break it down 
It's not so black and white 



<A NAME="dre"><h3>The Dreaming Tree</h3></a>

Standing here 
 The old man said to me 
"Long before these crowded streets 
Here stood my dreaming tree" 
 Below it he would sit 
 For hours at a time 
Now progress takes away 
 What forever took to find 
Now he's falling hard 
 He feels the falling dark 
How he longs to be 
Beneath his dreaming tree 
Conquered fear to climb 
A moment froze in time 
When the girl who first he kissed 
Promised him she'd be his 
Remembered mother's words 
There beneath the tree 
"No matter what the world 
You'll always be my baby" 
 Mommy come quick 
 The dreaming tree has died 
 The air is growing thick 
A fear he cannot hide 
 The dreaming tree has died 
Oh have you no pity 
This thing I do 
I do not deny it 
 All through this smile 
As crooked as danger 
I do not deny 
I know in my mind 
I would leave you now 
If I had the strength to 
I would leave you up 
To your own devices 
Will you not talk 
Can you take pity 
I don't ask much 
But won't you speak 
Please 
From the start 
She knew she had it made 
Easy up 'til then 
For sure she'd make the grade 
Adorers came in hordes 
To lay down in her wake 
She gave it all she had 
 But treasures slowly fade 
Now she's falling hard 
 She feels the fall of dark 
How did this fall apart 
She drinks to fill it up 
A smile of sweetest flowers 
Wilted so and soured 
Black tears stain the cheeks 
That once were so admired 
 She thinks when she was small 
There on her father's knee 
How he had promised her 
"You1ll always be my baby" 
 "Daddy come quick 
 The dreaming tree has died 
 I can't find my way home 
There is no place to hide 
 The dreaming tree has died" 
Oh if I had the strength... 
 Take me back 
Save me please 
  


<A NAME="spo"><h3>Spoon</h3></a>

Spoon has come 
Stirring my Coffee 
I thought of you 
and turned to the gate 
and on my way came up with the answers 
I scratched my head and the answers were gone 

From hand to hand, 
Wrist to the Elbow. 
Read 
Blood sand could there be god? 
Crosses Cross out like a wet rag 
Forgive you why you hung me out to dry. 

maybe I'm crazy But laughing out loud 
make the pain pass by 
And maybe your little crazy 
From Laughing out Loud 
With yourself 

I'm Holding.. I'm holding 
I'm still falling down still falling 

Spoon has come 
Stirring my Coffee 
I thought of this and turned to the gate 
And on my way cracked lightning then thunder 
I hit my head and the storm slipped away 
And maybe I'm crazy from laughing out loud make it all pass by 
Maybe your little crazy to laughing out loud make it all right. 

Laughing out loud 

(Alanis) From time to time minutes and hours 
Move ahead soon like a highness 
In the moon and rise and vanish 
This drop of hope falls from time 

(Dave) Spoon in Spoon 
Strirring my coffee 
I think of this and turn to go away 
Well as i walk, the voices behind me say 
Send the sin come now on way 

Laugh out loud 
Come now on way 



<A NAME="sta"><h3>Stay</h3></a>

We were walking 
Just the other day 
It was so hot outside 
You could fry an egg 
Remember you were talking 
 I watched as sweat ran down your face 
 Reached up and caught it at your chin 
Licked my fingertip 
Wasting time 
Let the hours roll by 
  Doing nothing for the fun 
Little taste of the good life 
Whether right or wrong 
Makes us want to stay, stay, stay 
for awhile 
Later on the sun began to fade 
Then the clouds rolled over our heads 
And it began to rain 
Oh we were dancing mouths open 
Splashing tongue taste 
 For a moment this good time would never end 
You and me 
You and me 
Just wasting time 
  I was kissing you 
You were kissing me love 
From good day into a moonlight 
Now a night so fine 
 Makes us wanna stay, stay, stay, stay for awhile 
Wasting time 
I shall miss these things 
When it all rolls by 
What a day 
Wanna stay, stay, stay, stay for awhile 
 Hey love 
Oh just groping you 
Rolling in the mud 
  Stay a while 
Come on love 
Wanna stay, stay, stay, stay for awhile 



<A NAME="cru"><h3>Crush</h3></a>

Crazy, how it feels tonight. 
Crazy, how you make it all alright, loves. 

Crush Me, 
With those things you do 
And I'll do for you 
Anything, too, oh... 

Sitting, smoking, feeling high... 

And in this moment 
Oh, it feels so right... 

Lovely lady, I'm at your feet, 
Oh, God I want you so badly. 
And I wonder this 
Could tomorrow be so wonderous 
As you lay sleeping. 

Let's go drive 'til morning comes, 
Watch the sunrise and fill our souls up, 
And drink some wine till we get drunk. 
Yes... 

Crazy, I'm thinking, 
Just knowing that the world is round 
And here I'm dancing on the ground 
Am I right side up or upside down? 
And is this real, or am I dreaming? 

Lovely lady, let me drink you, please. 
Won't spill a drop, no, I promise you 
Lying under a spell you cast on me 
Each moment the more I love you. 

Crush me, come on 
Oh, yes... 

Crazy, I'm thinking 
Just knowing that the world is round 
And here I'm dancing on the ground 
Am I right side up or upside down? 
Is this real at all, or am I dreaming? 

Lovely lady, I will treat you sweetly 
Adore you, I mean... 
You Crush me, 
And it's times like these 
When I think I really know 
How I love you. 

Come on, come on, baby... 

Crazy, I'm thinking 
Just as long as you're around 
And here I'll be dancing on the ground 
Am I right side up or upside down? 
To each other we'll be facing 
My love, my love, 
We'll beat back the pain we've found 
You know I mean to tell you 
All the things I've been thinking 
Deep inside, my friend. 
Each moment the more I love you. 

Crush me, come on, baby... 

So much you have given, oh 
That I would give you back, again and again. 
Oh, the love, many now hold you, 
But please, please, just let me, always.  



<A NAME="hall"><h3>Halloween</h3></a>

Hey little dreamer's eyes open and staring up at me
Oh little lonely eyes open and radiant

Wait until I come and I will steal you
Wait until I come I'll take your soul
Wait until I come and I will steal you
Wait until I come and I won't go

Darlin' dreamin in the night
Shadows on the windows
Lead oh and everyone go
Well leave me on the night
I will give you lightning
I will not relinquish light

Oh little dreamer eyes open and raving here

Wait until I come and see you little girl
When we come I'll leave with you too
When we come I'll let you come low

Hey we'll leave it all behind
Oh and then the nightmares
I'll fill them in good time
Oh they will seat your mind
When the light hits
And you maybe'll ask me

Why do you run around here
Why do you come inside of me
Why does it rip me out in dream
Why then why then watch this little fuck

Going away

Why this lonely
Why this lonely
Why this lonely love

Why this lonely
Why this lonely
Why this lonely love

Halloween
Carry on
Bury all
Bury all
Bury all
Bury all
Bury all

And in this dream
Tell us are you satisfied with fucking

Don't walk away
Don't walk away
Don't walk away
I'm talking to you

Love is hell
Love is hell
Love is hell
Love this I'll tame you

Love
Love
Love
Love this not me here

Love
Love
Love
Love him up to you



<A NAME="don"><h3>Dont Drink The Water</h3></a> 

Come out, come out, no use in hiding. 
Come out, come out, can you not see 
There's no place here, what were you expecting? 
No room for both, just room for me. 

So you will lay your arms down, 
Yes, I will call this home. 

Away, away, you have been banished. 
Your land is gone, and given to me. 

And here I will spread my wings. 
Yes, I will call this home. 

What's this you say, you feel a right to remain? 
Then stay and I will bury you. 

What's that you say, your father's spirit still lives in this place? 
Well, I will silence you. 

Here's the hitch, your horse is leaving. 
Don't miss your boat, it's leaving now. 

And as you go I will spread my wings. 
Yes, I will call this home. 
I have no time to justify to you, 
Fool, you're blind, move aside for me. 

All I can say to you my new neighbor, 
You must move on or I will bury you. 

Now as I rest my feet by this fire 
Those hands once warmed here, but I have retired them. 
I can breathe my own air and I can sleep more soundly 
Upon these poor souls, 
I'll build Heaven and call it home. 
Cause you're all dead now. 

I live with my justice 
And I live with my greed in me 
I live with no mercy 
And I live with my frenzied feet 
I live with my hatred 
And I live with my jealousy 
I live with the notion that I don't need anyone but me 

Don't Drink the Water 
Don't Drink the Water 
Blood in the water 
Don't Drink the Water  



<A NAME="rap"><h3>Rapunzel</h3></a>

Ha, open wide 
All so good I'll eat you 
Take me for a ride 
In your sweet delicious, 
Perfect little mouth 
There upon I linger 
You will have no doubt 
I'll do my best for you 
Love... 

Let's stop to get it going 
Lost myself just thinking 
'Bout the two of us 
From each other drinking 
Begin with the lips 
Fingertips and kissing 
Turn me inside out 
I do my best for you 

Up and down we go 
From the top you push me 
This is such a thrill 
Lost in love and dancing 
Shake your tamborine 
You blow my head wide open 
Of this there's no doubt 
I do my best for you 

From you I would crawl 
Through the darkest dungeon 
Climb the castle wall 
You are my Rapunzel 
You let down your hair 
Right in through your window 
Good they locked the door 
I do my best for you 

I think the world of you 
All of my heart I do 
Bloom through my veins for you 
You alone have all of me 
I give my world to you 
To you I'll be true 

From you my strength is full 
To carry your burdens too 

Too good to be real 
Smell of something cooking 
You my soul to steal 
Food of love we're filling 
What you've given me 
For it there is no measure 
Of one thing I am sure 
I'll give my best for you 

Hip lock up so tight 
You know drive me crazy 
Crazy is alright 
With you lookin' at me 
You make me feel high 
Every single thing you do to me 
Is like I'm drunk 
Given me given me 
The shiver
